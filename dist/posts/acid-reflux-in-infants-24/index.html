If you are one of the lucky ones, you will have a baby that sails through infanthood with nothing more than a cold or two. Others aren’t so lucky, however, and things can pop up that you may not even be able to see. Things like acid reflux in infants are something that most parents don’t even think about until their doctor suggests it as a possibility.</p><p>Acid reflux in infants is something that does not come up on the radar screen until everything else has been ruled out. The problem is something that has come into focus in recent years, and it has given a name to some of the problems babies have that used to fall under the colic category. Acid reflux in infants causes distress and sometimes a lot of pain, and there is really know way of knowing what is going on because it isn’t something you can see outwardly.</p><p>I have known a few parents that have dealt with acid reflux in infants, and they have told me that it took their doctors a long time to figure out what was going on. They said their babies had problems with throwing up. The doctors they went to first thought of changing formulas or giving gas medications, but acid reflux in infants was nothing one of their first thoughts. It is often a good practice to go with the common problems first, but if your baby has acid reflux, they can be in a lot of pain while waiting for your doctor to narrow down the problem.</p><p>If you suspect that you are dealing with acid reflux in infants, make sure you speak up and say so to your doctor. Keep track of the times when your baby might throw up or show signs of distress that cannot be explained by anything else. The sooner acid reflux in infants is found, the sooner you can bring some relief to your baby. Though some babies are just naturally cranky and there are many who cannot tolerate certain food items, you don’t want those to be the only things your doctor looks at when you feel your baby is in pain. Find information online about reflux and see what you can do to offer some comfort when they are hurting, and make sure your doctor takes you seriously.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
