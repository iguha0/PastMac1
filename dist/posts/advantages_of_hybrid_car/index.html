The reason behind this is that hybrid cars do not depend mainly on fuel for it to have power, but it also makes use of electricity that results to a smaller amount of fuel consumption and less emitted air pollution.</p><p>A hybrid car combines an electric motor and gasoline engine to provide sufficient power to the vehicle with least fuel usage and fewer emissions. They are also far more fuel-efficient than purely gas-powered cars, and far more practical for everyday use than purely electric-powered cars. Combining the two sources of power, a vehicle then is created that is relatively non-polluting and will lead to less fuel consumption which means it possesses enough power to have freeway speeds that does not need too much fuel, it is also great for the stop and go driving in traffic laden areas.</p><p>The hybrid car was created due to the result of the demand and clamor to clean the environment from pollutions and for the need to rely less on fuel. To be able to recharge, plugging the hybrid into an electric outlet is not necessary.They charge themselves by means of power usually lost during coasting and braking and can also be charged by the car’s gasoline engine.</p><p>It can offer more benefits than the usual regular gasoline engine type cars. Here is a list of the many advantages hybrid cars offers.</p><ol><li>Pollution is less promoted</li></ol><p>It is a fact that the continuous damage to our ozone layer is due to the greenhouse effect, and one of the factor that contributes to its damage is pollution in the air, in which dangerous chemicals are transferred to the air, like carbon dioxide that are emitted by vehicles. The measure of carbon dioxide emitted by the hybrid vehicle is principally relative to the quantity of fuel it consumes; thus hybrid cars can absolutely be a contributing factor in lessening the advancement of global warming.</p><p>With the use of hybrid cars, fewer fuel is consumed because hybrid car do not totally use gas in order to operate, it also makes use of electricity, a power source that doesn’t bring any danger to the environment.</p><ol start=2><li>More mileage with less fuel consumption</li></ol><p>The obvious advantage of hybrid car is that it saves on gas. With the use of hybrid cars, you are able to save gas money because you don’t need to buy gas after every long trip wherein you can go several miles consuming less fuel.</p><ol start=3><li>Hybrid cars can help lower your taxes</li></ol><p>Tax rebates are given to hybrid cars buyers, so if you buy a hybrid car your tax refunds can be withheld from your taxes and will provide you with additional savings.</p><ol start=4><li>Your money gains more value</li></ol><p>A hybrid car can retain a higher resale value. If you ever want to trade or sell a previously owned hybrid car you can be sure that you will get more of what you paid for it.</p><ol start=5><li>Efficiency and performance are what defines Hybrid Cars</li></ol><p>Hybrid cars have smaller engines than the regular gasoline cars since the power is obtained form two sources, so the smaller engines are closer to the normal power necessity of engines that will give an efficient performance.</p><ol start=6><li>“Hybrid car technology” is the greatest solution to today’s increasing problem in car air pollution</li></ol><p>Hybrid cars uses lesser fuel and a groundbreaking technology that may avoid possible damages to the environment caused by the usual cars</p><p>Despite of many uses and advantages, there is one thing to be considered regarding the hybrid cars, its actual price in the market is not yet that affordable to a lot of people, but it is an investment that will pay a hundred fold.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
