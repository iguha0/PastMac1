If so, it is likely that you have grown accustomed to carrying your tools around with you, wherever you go. In fact, there is also a chance that you may need to travel with them. Whether you are traveling for business purposes or not, it is important to know that the airline industry as a specific set of air travel rules concerning tools. If you are planning on brining your tools along with you, you will want to take the time to famialrize yourself with these rules. Doing so may prove helpful, in more ways than one.</p><p>Before examining the tools that are not allowed aboard an airline and those that are, it is important to know one thing, there are different types of rules. Most airlines do not strictly prohibit you from carry tools with you, but they do restrict you from carry them at certain times. For instance, you will find that a large number of tools can be stored in your checked baggage, but they are prohibited from being stored in your carryon luggage. If, at anytime, you are confused about these bans, you are advised to contact your airline for additional information.</p><p>One group of tools that are banned from carryon luggage includes sharp objects. With the recent focus on airport security, you should already be well aware of this type of ban. Saws, saw blades, drills, and box cutters are banned from all airplane cabins. Essentially, this means that you cannot store these items in your carryon luggage; however, they can be packed in your checked baggage. Since all baggage, including the bags that you do not plan on keeping with you at all times, needs to be searched, you are advised to properly secure these tools. Not doing so may result in an air airline employee receiving an injury that could have been prevented.</p><p>In addition to tools with sharp edges, there is also a carryon luggage ban on tools that could be used as a deadly weapon. These tools include axes, hatchets, cattle prods, hammers, and crowbars. This ban is mostly imposed due to the size and weight of these items. As with most other tools, the airline industry will allow you to store these heavy tools in your checked baggage.</p><p>Although it may seem as if all tools are banned from your carryon luggage, that is not the case. There are a number of tools can be stored in your carryon luggage. These tools commonly include screwdrivers and pliers. Additional tools may also be allowed, but they must not have been mentioned above. It is also required that these tools be no more than seven inches long. In the event that they are longer than seven inches, you will have to make additional accommodations.</p><p>Despite the fact that certain tools can be stored in your carryon luggage, it may be a good idea to put these items in your checked baggage or leave them at home. Even though these items are allowed, you may raise suspicion from having them with you aboard a plane. That suspicion may not necessity come from airport security officials, but it may come from other passengers. With the way that the world works today, it may be best if you refrain from including these tools in your carryon luggage, unless you absolutely need them.</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>Word Count 563</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
