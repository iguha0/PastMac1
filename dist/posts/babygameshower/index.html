But baby games shower are much more fun since moms-to-be, godparents, grandparents, and other invitees in the baby shower can get to play childish games again. Some of the baby game shower that can be played include Sing It, Baby!, Measuring up Mommy, Here’s Looking at You, Kid!, Don’t Say Baby, Baby Truth or Dare, The Seventh Gift, and Dig out the Pins.</p><p>These baby games are the common baby game showers usually played. They are a great way that would let the guests mingle and get to know each other, if they aren’t acquainted yet. This is also another great way to give honor to the mom-to-be for having that precious baby on the way.</p><p>How do we play these baby game showers? Here is the run-down on how to play the baby game shower and create good memories of a great baby shower.</p><p>In Sing It, Baby!, the guests participants form a circle. They can sit or stand. Then, each guest must sing a line or two from a song that has the word “baby” in it. When the first game player has finished, the next person seated on her right has ten seconds to sing another “baby” song. “Baby” songs cannot be repeated, thus, participants who repeat a song or cannot think of a “baby” song gets booted out of the game. Last person singing in this baby game shower wins the prize!</p><p>How big has mommy become? Measuring Up Mommy is the baby game shower to play as this gives the guests the freedom to measure mommy’s size. Have a couple of toilet paper rolls ready and ask each participant to estimate the size of mommy’s girth by cutting the toilet paper to their guess size. Then each one wraps around the new mommy’s stomach the toilet paper they cut. The nearest length approximating to the mommy’s stomach wins the prize!</p><p>Remember how you looked when you were a baby? This game takes you down memory lane as you need to dig up those baby pictures of yours. Because you need them to play the baby game shower Here’s Lookin’ At You, Kid! Before the party itself, request all the guests coming to bring the cutest baby picture of themselves. Upon their arrival, secure each baby picture and assign a number per picture. During the game, lay all baby pictures and give each participant paper and pen and ask them to identify as many baby pictures as they can. The guest with the most number of correct guesses is the big winner.</p><p>This baby game shower makes you NOT say what you are suppose to be attending to! The game Don’t Say Baby is precisely that! Don’t say “baby” during the entire length of the baby game shower for the diaper pin that was given to you upon your arrival will be taken away from you. The person with the most number of diaper pins collected at the end of the shower party wins a prize.</p><p>This baby game shower is for those who love baby trivia and the like. Play Baby Truth or Dare by writing down some baby trivia, some correct and others purposely written incorrectly. During the baby game shower, ask randomly if the baby facts are either true or false. Those who guess correctly gets a prize while those who don’t will be dared to perform in front of everyone else.</p><p>We all know that the single lady who catches the bride’s wedding bouquet is said to become the next bride. In The Seventh Gift, it is not so much a baby game shower but more of a fable that says that the giver of the seventh gift unwrapped will be the next expecting mother. However, avoid “planting” the seventh gift.</p><p>Last but not the least, Dig Out the Pins is the baby game shower that tests the agility of the guests as they fish out the most number of diaper pins from a large bowl filled with uncooked rice and diaper pins in under two minutes. The participant that has the most number of pins brings home the prize.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
