Selling printed information by mail can be financially rewarding. Classified advertising is the cheapest way to get into Mail Order and it is often possible to raise a fortune from these small ads. Just check any large publication such as Popular Mechanics, for their classified advertising section and you can see yourself the many ads.</p><p>These small ads, running month after month would not be there if they were not profitable and making money. according to some of the promotional material being sent around the country, you could make up to $500.00 or possibly more by running the following classified ads over your name and address. They ask you to pick up a top national publication and test either one or both under “Money-Making Opportunities” headings and watch the dollars come in. I did not run any of these ads myself but was told they really are both profitable. Here are the programs and the advertisements:</p><p>“How would you like to receive $25 daily and keep all the money? For complete set-up rush $1 to (Your name and address)”</p><p>” $500 monthly, work at home, receive money daily. For complete set-up send $1 to (Your name and address here)”</p><p>You are supposed to fill orders you receive with a copy of this sheet you are now reading. Make photocopies or get a supply printed to send as needed.</p><p>There are other variations of this plan, but all serve the same purpose: to sell printed information to people who are interested in making some extra money. (they say it is truly possible to make money with this plan).</p><p>If you study the many classified ads in the big national publications, you may get a better idea of what the leading companies in Mail Order are doing. You will get a better idea of how classified advertising works. if you have limited capital, it would be wise to run your ads in smaller publications such as small newspapers, small Mail Order Publications and adsheets.</p><p>If you have sufficient capital, some good pulling national magazines or Tabloids are:</p><p>*Popular Mechanics *Money Making Opportunities *Salesman’s Opportunities *Specialty Salesman *Mechanics Illustrated *National Enquirer And many others to numerous to mention.</p><p>many such magazines tabloids and other good publications are available at your local news stand, library or through Mail Order. Many of them require a copy of the material you are selling with your ad and reserve the right not to print certain ads they feel may be injurious to the public or the image of their publication</p><p>Yes! You can start your own advertising and mailing business at home and keep finances ahead of inflation but be sure you are involved in the kind of program that gives you a reasonable chance to be a winner!</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
