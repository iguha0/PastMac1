Employers will do a background check before hiring someone in order to be certain that the individual will be reliable and trustworthy. Landlords may run a background check on potential tenants before signing any contracts. Some people may secretly do a background check on someone they are dating through a private investigator. There are various and numerous reasons that people will do a background check on someone.</p><p>Recently, in my hometown, a man was arrested that shocked everyone. He was a convicted sex offender who managed to do some rearranging of his personal information and was working at a daycare center. The daycare center had performed a background check on him prior to offering him a job, but because of his arranged changes, he checked out absolutely fine. It was only by luck that a social services worker was looking through some staff photos and had previously worked in a different state. It just so happened that the previous state she’d worked in had arrested the same man. By recognizing his photo, she was able to do some investigating and find out that it was indeed the same man. All of those children had been put at risk simply because this man found a way to alter his personal information. This is becoming simpler to do now when you have some determined people. Who knows if he managed to do any damage to these unsuspecting children. I am incredibly thankful that my child does not attend that childcare, but it could happen at hers as well. Honestly, it was not the fault of the daycare center because they had performed all of the proper precautions before hiring him. It just is incredibly unfortunate.</p><p>There are many instances in which more tragedies may have been prevented in this world had someone put some effort or emphasis on performing a background check. Too many people are too trusting of people that they are hiring nowadays. Sure, it is very sad that the world has come to the point in which we are told to trust others but not really. Any position that would be putting someone near children or money would make me do a background check. All you have to do is turn on the news or open the newspaper today to see some examples. Of course, there is always the occasional person who commits a crime and has no record whatsoever. In that case, a background check wouldn’t have helped in the least. But, if society can help to prevent even one tragedy from happening, it will have made a background check a wonderful concept.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
