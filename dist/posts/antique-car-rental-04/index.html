Have you ever stood on a trail on the edge of a cliff? You know there is very little chance that you will fall – how often, after all, do you suddenly fall for no reason. Nevertheless, no matter how much you try to convince yourself, you are scared to death of falling. Antique car rentals are kind of like that. I haven’t been in an accident in years, but as soon as I was renting vintage cars, I was suddenly frightened of every driver that I saw. I couldn’t even trust myself!</p><p>The antique car rental was not my idea. It was actually for a movie that a good friend of mine was doing. He is not very well connected, but he is extremely well-funded. He took a sizable inheritance and turned it into a fortune through his own clever financial skills. After that, he got frivolous. He decided that he wanted to be a filmmaker, and invested huge amounts of money in failed project after failed project. This one was going to be his big one, and I was along for the ride.</p><p>I have to admit that one of the main reasons that I was involved in this scheme was for the chance to drive the antique rental car. It was a beauty. I don’t know that much about classic car sales, but I know a beautiful automobile when I see one. This was a huge, old Mustang. It was big as a boat and twice as luxurious. The antique car rental cost an arm and a leg, but it was pennies compared to what he was going to spend on the film as a whole. As I was the only sane one in the crew, I was nominated to drive the car. I though I was up for the challenge.</p><p>Nonetheless, once I got behind the wheel of that antique car rental, I was so scared of crashing it that I couldn’t do the driving right. I didn’t have the right flare, you see. I took the turns too slowly and made my way to cautiously. I was supposed to be an a young, rebellious kid out for a cruise. Instead, I drove like a granny. Nonetheless, after an afternoon of that, I finally loosened up. We got the take we needed, drove the car back, and went out for a steak dinner. All in all, it was a good day shooting.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
