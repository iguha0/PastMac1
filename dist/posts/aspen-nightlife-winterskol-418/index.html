This is literally a celebration of winter, cold, and snow – which is a great deal of what makes Aspen, well, Aspen! Winterskol is the ultimate Aspen party.</p><p>Winterskol is held during the month of January each year, and it is the wildest winter celebration you will ever experience. The highlight of Winterskol is the Canine Fashion Show, where pets are dressed up in crazy clothing, such as miniature bridal gowns. Winterskol has been an Aspen tradition for more than fifty years – and it will continue for at least another fifty! The first Winterskol celebration was held in 1951.</p><p>During Winterskol, more than 40 events are scheduled in the downtown area, Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk Mountain, and Snowmass Mountain. The entire area gets involved in the activities. Winterskol is a celebration of Aspen’s Nordic ancestry, as well as a celebration of winter. While most events are scheduled in advance, Winterskol also brings several surprises as well. You just never know what you will find at the Winterskol celebration – until you are there.</p><p>Favorite traditional activities include the Canine Fashion Show, Winter sculpt, the Buttermilk Uphill Race, and Snowmass Splash. Don’t miss the torchlight descent and the fireworks display over Aspen Mountain. Don’t miss the unique competitions happening all over town. There is constant live entertainment all around town as well. If you are planning a ski vacation, and you want to have the time of your life – your destination should be Aspen, and your arrival date should coincide with the start of Winterskol.</p><p>Winterskol is an ongoing week long party with something for everyone. Amusement, entertainment, parties, and celebration are top priorities during the week of Winterskol. You have to experience Winterskol at least once in your lifetime – and after you have been once, you will be back. Winterskol is a celebration that is comparable with Mardi Gras in New Orleans – but a lot safer, and in many opinions, more enjoyable.</p><p>As they do for Mardi Gras, people come from all over the world for Winterskol. Event packages are available, but all of the lodges, hotels, motels, condos, cabins, and campgrounds sell out early. Make sure that you book lodging for Winterskol well in advance, and take advantage of the packages that the various lodges offer. Packages typically include lodging, airfare, rental cars, and other things that you may require as well.</p><p>(word count 418)</p><p>PPPPP</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
