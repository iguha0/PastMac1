In fact, it is an excellent stress reliever and can keep a person healthier than they might be if they never laughed. If you’ve ever gotten the privilege of seeing the Blue Collar comedy tour in person or on television, you probably laughed away some stress. The four individuals who travel the country and make up the Blue Collar comedy tour are some of the funniest comedians in the business. They are down-to-earth and for the most part - clean in their skits. While I don’t mind a bit of foul language and sexual innuendos on occasion, it is always refreshing to see a comedian focusing on other areas of humor. For that, I praise them.</p><p>I haven’t gotten to see the Blue Collar comedy tour in person, but I’ve watched the televised version on Comedy Central over and over again. Though I know the skits and jokes by now, I still find myself laughing hysterically. I did, however, have the wonderful opportunity to see the Blue Collar comedy tour’s Ron White when he was touring. He stopped near my hometown and I purchased tickets the moment they went on sale. We had excellent seats and by the end of the evening, I had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard. My husband said the he’s never enjoyed a comedy show as much as he had that night. He begged me to find out if and when the Blue Collar comedy tour would be coming near our town in the future. I did some research but found nothing local. My mother and father saw Jeff Foxworthy when they were on vacation a few years ago and praised him tremendously.</p><p>Of course, any fans of the Blue Collar comedy tour know that there is now a Blue Collar comedy rides again that has come about. It is still the same four wonderfully funny guys with new humor and new reasons to laugh. My husband has both of the performances on DVD and no matter how many times he’ll watch them, I can hear him laughing no matter where I am in the house. If you know anyone who enjoys comedy, the DVD’s make an excellent gift. Tickets to see the Blue Collar comedy tour live would be an excellent gift as well.</p><p>I do know that if I ever get my hands on any tickets for the Blue Collar comedy tour, I will be the first to arrive. Well, if my husband doesn’t knock me over in his mad dash to claim his seat!</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
