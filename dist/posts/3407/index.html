When you come right down to it, the only things needed for anyone to make bundles of money are the long-range vision and the energy to put a money-making plan into force.</p><p>One of the easiest methods of building wealth, and the one most often used by the “smart” people, is to furnish the expertise, equipment or growth capital to promising beginning business. Basically, you buy in as either a part owner or limited partner; then, as the busines grows and propers with your help, you reap your share of rewards.</p><p>The beautiful part about this whole concept is that you can repeat this procedure over and over again. You can start out with, say marketing and sales leadership for small, garage-type business; then with your holdings and earnings from that business, invest in another, and keep doing this until you own a part of twenty-five to an unlimited number of businesses. Looking at the idea from a dollar return point of view, if you were getting $200 per month from 25 different business, your monthly income would amount to no less than $5,000 and that’s not too bad for a fledgling millionaire.</p><p>Look around your own area. With just a little bit of business sense and perception, you’re sure to find hundreds of small businesses that could do better—perhaps even become giants in their—with your help.</p><p>Most small businesses need, and would welcome marketing, promotional, advertising, and sales help. If a quick survey of business turns you on with enthusiasm about the potential profits to be made with just a few changes that you can suggest, then you are on your way.</p><p>Basically, you set up an appointment to see and talk with business owners about some ideas and help that could double or triple their profits. When you approach them in that manner, their almost certain to want to see you and hear want you have to say.</p><p>In prepartion for your meeting, set your ideas down on paper. Put them together in an impressive marketing or profit potential folio. Outline your ideas, the costs involvrd and the ultimate profit to be gained.</p><p>Then, when you arrive for the meeting, be sure to look nad act the part of a successful business person.A few pleasantries to break the ice, and begin with your presentation.</p><p>Through your proposal, you must instill confidence that you can do all you claim for him. Guide him through the presentation to the ultimate profits---- all for a 10 or 20 percent limited partnership in the business, which really won’t cost him anything. Of course, if he is reluctant to give up any part of his ownership, you come back with the idea of being hired as a consultant.</p><p>Almost all small businesses need help of some kind. The owners get bogged down in a myraid of every day problems and things to do. They find there just are not enough hours in the day to handle everything that should be taken care of, and end up neglecting or putting off some of the things they should be doing to keep the business prosperous. As a result, the long struggle for business survival begins, with more than 60% of them selling out at a loss or just closing up shop.</p><p>The other way to ” cut yourself in” on a piece of someone else’s business is to supply needed money. If you can come up with 10 or 15 thousand dollars, you can easily “buy into” some small businesses. Be sure to look the business ( and its market potential) over; but once you spot one that can really be a winner with just a little bit of operating cash or money for expansion, then start figuring!</p><p>You can reach a never ending supply of such businesses to choose from, simply by running a small advertisement in your daily newspaper in the .Classified section under the heading of Business Opportunities Wanted. Such an ad might read:</p><p>SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS EXECUTIVE LOOKING FOR NEW BUSINESS VENTURES. WILL CONSIDER BUY OUT OR PARTNERSHIP. PO BOX 123, CITY</p><p>By the same token, make it a habit to look through the Business Opportunities Available on a regular basis. Mark a few each day and follow up. Check them out, And see what kind of a deal is being offered. Remember, proper management and planning are basically the ingredients to success in business; and most small businesses just do not have these ingredients in the proportions needed to attain their greatest profit potential.</p><p>Other people have done it, and more are starting up every day. There’s no reason why you can’t do it. In most cases little or no cash is needed. But with a little bit of action on your part, you could quickly become a multi-business owner, and very wealthy as well.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
