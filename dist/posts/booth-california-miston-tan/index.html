There are various ways on how to get a tan. Traditionally when you want to get a tan you would have to sunbathe for long hours. But long exposure to ultraviolet rays can be damaging to the skin and often cause skin cancer. And usually instead of getting a tan you get sunburned which is awfully painful at times.</p><p>Another way of getting a tan is to use tanning lotion. This is one safe method but the effect is not really that remarkable since tanning lotion often wears off easily. Plus if you do not know how to correctly apply them you would have an uneven tan.</p><p>But thanks to new tanning technology now you can have that tanned skin you always dreamed of.</p><p>Getting a Tan from California Mist-on Booth</p><p>The increasing demand for sunless tanning has encouraged tanning booths in California. And at present there are two sunless booths available in the market and these are the Mystic Tan and the Mist-On Systems. Both of these booths are designed to provide beautiful and even tan without the streaks. How do these booths come up with beautiful, glowing tan?</p><p>These booths make use of spray to even out the application of sunless tanning lotion on the body. However the spray technology used is not like your ordinary spray. It makes use of an atomized lotion formula that when applied to the body tends to bonds evenly. The atomized lotion works like little magnets accumulating on the body and at the same time repelling other forms of drops making the tan to really stick on the body.</p><p>The whole process usually takes at least fourteen seconds to apply on each part of the body to come up with a dark tan. - Easy and quick, achieved without the harmful UV rays exposure.</p><p>However, it is important to note that different booths provide different results due to the varied methods applied. Like for instance, a tanning booth can make use of formulas that include bronzers. Such types of formulas are perfect for providing instant tanning color.</p><p>On the other hand there are also those that contain DHA ingredients and often take more hours for tan to develop depending on a person’s skin type. The DHA containing tanning formula is more preferred especially if you want long lasting tan. It can last for up to four days without requiring for re-application.</p><p>Aside from the tanning formulas used the spray also varies. A tanning booth may use an eight nozzle spray to even out the distribution of the tanning lotion on the body. All the user has to do is to step inside the booth, adjust the nozzle and then simply press the button to activate the spray. After four rotations the tanning process is completed and the user can step out of the booth towel off any excess lotion and then dress up and go.</p><p>If you want to maintain your tan it is advisable that you visit your tanning booth every 4 to 5 days. Another advantage of choosing tanning booths over other tanning products or methods is that the formulas used do not stain and are non-greasy. So you won’t have to worry tainting your favorite clothes.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
