You mail these out and the ads “appear” to be your own. You receive money for whatever is advertised on the circular. You keep 50% and the dealer who sent you the circulars will fill the order for you for the other half.</p><p>Never mail out a single circular by itself. Mail as many of the different circulars as you can, in the same envelope. Stuff your envelopes full. The more you mail to one customer, the more likely you’ll make a sale and the less will be the per unit mailing cost. Mail order enthusiasts do read these circulars!</p><p>Next, run ads in different magazines saying that you mail circulars for others. Charge whatever you determine is fair. Use the standard rate charged by others in the business. You can get this information easily by checking several dealers offering this service in the various mailorder publications and adsheets. Then determine a fair charge based on the variations of your services from the normal operations.</p><p>Always mention in your ads that “WE MAIL COMMISSION CIRCULARS FREE!” Whichever part of the ad the reader responds to, you can make money. It is possible to run this business into a full time job and make good money well worth the effort you put into it.</p><p>The best plan to follow is to keep growing. Run an ad every chance you get. Take on new commission circulars, test them, keep the ones that pull, omit the ones that do not pull. Before you realize it, you will graduate from a part-time mailer to a full time money-maker!</p><p>Nine Steps That Put You in the Commission Mailing Business:</p><ol><li><p>Order a good rubber stamp with your name and address on it.</p></li><li><p>Send for some free imprints (Commission Circulars). You pay only the postage for these. They are available from prime source mailorder firms.</p></li><li><p>Buy a supply of envelopes and stamps.</p></li><li><p>Address the envelopes to the names wanting big mail.</p></li><li><p>When you receive your circulars, stamp your name and address in the blank space on the commission side of the imprint.</p></li><li><p>Put one of each type of circular in each envelope, filling to the maximum weight for each level of postage rate.</p></li><li><p>Mail them.</p></li><li><p>When you receive orders, take out your commission.</p></li><li><p>Forward everything else to the source. (The firm or individual) who sent you the circulars… and you are in business!</p></li></ol><p>If you are serious about commission mailing, you will take the time to look over each offer in the Big Mails you receive. Most everything one needs to follow the nine steps above is offered in the various Big Mail Packets, most of it free.</p><p>There is money in mailing, but it is not as some advertise it You won’t make $50,000 a year by working one hour a week from your kitchen table. NO! It doesn’t work that way.</p><p>If you will follow instructions, be happy with from $100 to $400 a week, spending a few hours every night, five nights a week, then you too can make money in mailing the various offers available to you.</p><p>The nine steps listed above give you everything you need to get started. It is now up to you. You invest only what you wish, you grow as big as you want. Just one note of advice… When you send your commission circulars, send more than one of a kind… You will pay the same postage to mail one as you will to mail several. The more you mail at one time, the better the odds of receiving orders. It’s also a good policy to never get your circulars and your name lists to mail to from the same dealer.</p><p>Yes! Using these nine steps can put you in the commission mailing business!</p><p>Making Money With Your Own Adsheet!</p><p>When you are in a position to publish your own adsheet you will be able to expand your basic commission mailing business for additional profits.</p><p>Adsheets are usually started by the publisher cutting ads from other magazines and making paste-ups with these “Freebies”. The publisher then mails his adsheets to these various dealers and asks them to re-run their ads with him at $$ per column inch. This is a risky beginning because many dealers are not in a position to buy, or do not want to purchase additional ad space for one reason or another.</p><p>There are a number of publishers who have a method for starting adsheets that is almost 100% risk free. They send you partial page, or full page ads, that pay from 50% to 100% commission and you may run these ads over our name in your first edition of your adsheet. As paid ads come in, you simply replace these free ads with the paid ads.</p><p>Until you get paid ads for your publication, you have a chance to make money whether you have paid advertisers or not. Moreover some companies will give you substantial discounts on their various mailorder programs if you run their 3x6 ad in the first edition. Thus you can make money off of their ads and you get professionally designed mailorder programs at very little cost.</p><p>Also, there are a number of mailorder companies that have full line printing plants and they will print your adsheet for you at very competitive prices, in the event you don’t have your own printer.</p><p>As you dig deeper and deeper into the world of mailorder, you will be able to locate and contact many firms and individuals who will offer many and varied programs and services.</p><p>How to Get Your Circulars Mailed Free!</p><p>There is another way to get your circulars mailed free. As soon as you can afford it, become a supplier of commission circulars. The easiest way to do this is to take “all-profit” offers and have circulars printed on two sides. On one side have your own name and address printed. On the other side leave space for a rubber stamp imprint.</p><p>Offer these circulars to circular mailers on a commission basis. They keep a commission from 50% to 100% on the one side, and you make your profit on the other. Use the same method for any offers that you develop for yourself.</p><p>You can reach these mailers by advertising in, or subscribing to several mailorder trade magazines and adsheets. Another way to locate mailers for your literature is to notice the ads by mailers; usually at the bottom of their ads they state “Commission Circulars Mailed Free”, which means they get one side and you get the other, as above.</p><p>If you really want to get rolling using this method, take two “all Profit” offers, one on each side, and give the mailer 100% on one side. You still make yours on the other offer.</p><p>Also, if you are interested in obtaining additional commission circulars for yourself, include “Commission Circulars Mailed Free”, in your own ads.</p><p>Still another way to get your literature mailed free is to include this little note in all your advertising… at the end of the copy… “Stamp appreciated”. It only costs you two words, but it could save you a great deal in postage. If you are advertising in trade publications or adsheets use “SASE” which means “Self-Addressed, Stamped Envelope”. The savings from envelopes, addressing labor and postage can add up fast. Many small dealers use this method exclusively, even in the large circulation magazines. They have been using it for years and it still works!</p><p>How to Make $100 mailing 100 Envelopes By Using the Exchange Mailing Plan!</p><p>Regarding this plan they have been telling you to have 5,000 3x6 commission circulars printed, the circulars offering $1.00 items and paying 50% commission on every order received. Then mail 100 each to 50 “Exchange Mailers” in 50 envelopes marked X-100SY (which means Exchange 100-Send yours). When you receive 100 circulars from each of the exchange mailers, mail out one each in 50 envelopes. This way 100 envelopes mails your 5,000 circulars. If you have a good circular offering a popular seller, and the exchange mailers you sent yours to, are honest and dependable, you should receive at least a 2% return. Then they state that this plan will bring $50 profit.</p><p>This is the complete plan and they say it works. That it is working every day for many mailers and that it will work for you!</p><p>I have no doubt that it works; however the $50 profit they mention is Gross Profit before any expenses. Figure it up. By the time you purchase the printing, the envelopes and the stamps, your expenses will leave you little if any Net Profit.</p><p>Of course, if the exchange mailers send you top pulling circulars for their “fast selling products” and you receive 50% or more commission on orders from these, you can make a substantial Net Profit, perhaps enough to pay for your time and effort.</p><p>If you are serious about making money at home, commission mailing is one way to do it, but you must have circulars that offer top selling items. In this day and age of inflation and high postage costs it is difficult to make a buck by mailing circulars selling only $1.00 products. You should have a very minimum selling price of from $5.00 to $8.00 in order to pay you a reasonable amount!</p><p>For just the postage and handling, many mail order firms will send you commission circulars and the names of other mail order dealers who will send you all the names you want, FREE! There are other dealers who are happy to send you their circulars without the cost in order to defray their mailing expenses. All you have to do is write and request their circulars or place a small display ad in various mailorder advertisers and ad sheets indicating that you mail good commission circulars free!</p><p>You can get the names of a number of printers in the mailorder business who print commission circulars for a very reasonable fee. I would suggest that you order 6,000 3x6 circulars rather than 5,000 as suggested on the prior page for the simple reason most printers like to keep their printing formats and price schedules in round figures and 6,000 3x6’s (approximately 2-3/4 x 5-1/2, not actually 3x6) will fit on 1,000 sheets of the standard size 8-1/2x11 paper.</p><p>If you handle your commission programs on a conservative basis until you have tested and proven the value of each program, you can very well make $100+ by mailing 200 envelopes with an exchange mailing plan!</p><p>Postage Saving Tips</p><p>As with all your mailorder programs, just like any other business, you must operate efficiently and save dollars whenever and wherever possible. In your commission mailing programs it is especially important to get the most use out of every dollar you spend on postage and mailing costs. Errors and lack of planning when preparing mailing programs costs untold millions. Incorrect scales and mistaken rate calculations account for many more millions. The use of machines for folding and inserting, etc., can save substantially when your mailings get large enough to warrant their use.</p><p>Most letters mailed at one ounce rates weigh much less than one ounce. Save money by stuffing your mailings with other circulars and inserts unless your mailing involves a special offer that is best promoted separately. Most people do not realize that a #10 envelope plus five standard 8-1/2x11 sheets will go at the ounce rate. It also is a saving idea to print on both sides of your documents.</p><p>With a small battery operated mail opener that costs less than $20, you can open most envelopes quickly and easily without damage to the inserts.</p><p>To maintain your mailing list on a current basis it will pay to specify “Forwarding and Return Postage Guaranteed”, and “Address Correction requested”.</p><p>See your postmaster for third class bulk rate information. If you are mailing over 200 pieces you can mail for approximate 1/2 the usual cost. It’s a simple procedure to get set up for Bulk mailing. After an initial charge you can renew for an annual fee. You will get back the cost of the fees just in the first few hundred mailings, and ride at the bulk rate for the rest of the year. However, it can take from a week to two weeks for delivery. Paste on color stickers are used to indicate the destination, making it easy to sort and bundle by zip areas, etc.</p><p>Make sure everything is labelled properly and packaged well to minimize loss or damage.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
