Known to many aikido practitioners as “O Sensei” or the “Great Teacher,” Ueshiba was able to develop the martial art based on a purely physical level using techniques and movements such those of “Jujitsu” and “Kenjutsu” called “aikido.”</p><p>It is believed that aikido was first introduced to the Western culture way back in 1951 by a martial arts practitioner Minoru Mochizuki when he visited France. Then, he introduced aikido and several aikido techniques to judo students in different areas of France. After this introduction, Tadashi Abe, who cane as the official Aikikai Honbu representative in 1952, remained in France for less than seven years and continued the pursuit.</p><p>The following year, Kenji Tomiki conducted a tour along with various martial arts delegates in 15 continental states in the US. And in that same year, Koichi Tohei of Aikikai Honbu was sent by for a year to Hawaii just to set up a number of dojos. After invading the US, Aikido gained patronage in the UK, Germany, and Australia. Today, thousands of dojos are set up for those who would want to learn the practice of the martial art.</p><p>BITS AND PIECES OF AIKIDO</p><p>If you are interested with aikido but do not have the time and money to go to a dojo and enroll for an aikido class, then you should find other means to do so. One of the easiest ways to introduce yourself into the exciting world of aikido is to browse the Internet and look for aikido video clips.</p><p>Being a limitless source of any information, browsing the Internet for various aikido video clips can give you better options and the specific details you would want to learn. Today, there are so many websites that offer aikido clip videos for free for those who would want to learn the basics and for those who would want to get an idea how the martial art works before enrolling to it.</p><p>Usually, aikido video clips contain loose form training or popularly known as “ki nagare.” Here, the aikido practitioners are just playing around even and after the martial art presentation. The most viewed aikido video clips are those of famous aikido practitioners while conducting their classes or during their practice. But since these are just clips, it is not possible for you to learn everything about the techniques of the martial art.</p><p>Amateurs who document the practitioner’s lessons and stunts during practice usually take these aikido video clips. Since these are taken in impromptu, you cannot expect high quality resolution and sound. The most common problem would be is that the aikido video clip has a noisy background due to the noises created by people from neighboring gym hall or from the enthusiastic audience inside the dojo.</p><p>After filming, they upload these files into the Internet so others can see it. Although these are just short clips, there is a possibility that you pick up aikido techniques that you can practice. Unlike in full-length aikido videos, the variety of aikido techniques is limited when you watch an aikido video clip.</p><p>Aikido video clips are available in various aikido sites or from yahoo, google, and u-tube. There are many more websites that offer free aikido video clips but expect that limited amount of information can be gathered.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
