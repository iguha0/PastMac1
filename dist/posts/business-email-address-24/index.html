Though Yahoo is great for what I need if for, I do realize that many people won’t take you seriously if you have a Yahoo address, or any other web based email address for that matter, as you main contact email. I guess I have to look into spending the money to get web page and I will then be able to have my email address through the site.</p><p>Your business email address can say a lot about you and who you are and what you do. If you have one that comes from a professional site, you are going to look professional. I don’t know if my Yahoo email address has scared away any potential clients, but I certainly don’t want that to happen in the future. I need a good solid business email address to deal with clients, and if you have a business or work online, you need to have the same thing. The very best news is that it really doesn’t have to be that expensive, but this will depend on the volume of traffic you have on your site on any given day.</p><p>When you get your own web address, you have the option of having a business email address along with your site. If you get the web address with your name in it, you can have your email address that reflects that name. For example, if you get the domain johnfoxly.com, you can have a business email address that says <a href=mailto:John@johnfoxly.com>John@johnfoxly.com</a>. When you do this, you instantly look more professional in the eyes of those who are going to contact you for business.</p><p>I originally picked Yahoo for my business email address because I didn’t know what would happen next. I am grateful for the success I have had, and I like to think that my work speaks for itself, and that my business email address is not a turn off. I chose them because they were not only free; they also have a lot of storage space. I think, however, the time has come to get a better email address, even if it means I must build a site. In the end, it can only mean good thing for my career, and that is something that is always welcome.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a href=/posts class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600">Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
