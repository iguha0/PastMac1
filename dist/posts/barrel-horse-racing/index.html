This is basically a game event that aims to display speed.</p><p>The race is pretty simple to watch. It is played on an arena with three barrels arranged in an isosceles triangle pattern on which the intention of the racer is to gain the fastest speed by circling the three barrels in a cloverleaf pattern. While there may be standards as to the distance of each barrel, governing bodies normally have various preferences on how far each barrel should be set from one another.</p><p>The general distance is 90 feet from each barrel. However, some may use 60 feet up to 100 plus feet. The setting applies to all competitors.</p><p>The game begins once the racer enters the arena towards the first barrel. On this, the rider must enter at a slight angle since its much easier for the racer if he would not come straight on to it. A complete turn must be accomplished on the first barrel before moving to the second one.</p><p>A second turn, but this time an opposite one, will be made on the second barrel. And again, the rider will have to race towards the third barrel. The third barrel then will be circled around in the same direction as the second one. After a complete loop, the rider will have to accelerate back to the starting line, which is also considered as the finish line.</p><p>Like many other horse racing events, horse barrel racing has its common problems too. We will help you distinguish some of the most common problems and would try to suggest a couple of things to find a solution on it. Please read on.</p><p>The first barrel is usually termed to as the “money barrel”. This makes the most difficult turn since the horse has to approach it at full speed. Remember that the main aim of this game is to take it as fast as you can. This is also the most tricky barrel because if you knock it off, you are sure to be out of the game in no time and if you passed over it, you will have the chance to take some money with you.</p><p>The problem though comes with the horse that normally passes over this barrel due to lack of rate. Because the horse is charging at top speed, it has the tendency to become too aggressive. Thus, they may either knock the first barrel off or they may pass over it. This problem can be resolved through conditioning your horse to do the turn perfectly.</p><p>Some horses often have problems entering the arena. In this case, the horse is called “barrel sour” or “ring sour”. This is known to have rooted from running too much in the arena or over practice. This can be resolved through taking some time off the track and giving your horse a break from the barrel routines. One ideal way of doing this is to do trail riding.</p><p>Some horses tend to have no breaks at all. In this case, you must not allow your horse to run unless control is gained on it. Solution to this problem can start with running at slower gaits until progress is achieved. Run your horse on barrels only when you are confident enough of its speed and its capability to halt.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
