If you are planning on flying, you will find that most of these changes have occurred right at airports, namely airport security checkpoints. If you are about to head off to catch a flight, whether you leave tomorrow or in two weeks, it is advised that you famialrize yourself with these new air travel rules, namely the ones that are enforced at airport security checkpoints.</p><p>When it comes to airport security checkpoints, there are many passengers who only think of one checkpoint, but the reality is that there are actually three. The first checkpoint is when you go to register for your seat on the plane. This is the time when you will be presented with your boarding passes and when you must hand over the luggage that you would like checked. In addition to handing over your plane tickets or requesting your boarding passes, you will need to show the proper forms of identification. These items most commonly include a driver’s license or a government issued identification card.</p><p>Once you have received all of your boarding passes, for all of your flights, you will need to hand over your luggage that you will be leaving below in the plane. These bags are commonly referred to as checked baggage or checked luggage. As with your carryon luggage, your checked baggage will need to be checked for prohibited items. In the past, only a small number of bags were hand checked, but now almost all are. Many of these checks are quick look-overs, but you may be subject to a random, extensive search. This search often includes the checking of all baggage compartments, as well as the wiping of a cloth, which is looking for powdery substances.</p><p>When you have been cleared to the next stage, you will need to go through the main airport security checkpoints. This point is where you will be required to have your carryon luggage scanned by an x-ray machine. You will also need to walk through a metal detector. In the past, only random travelers were asked to remove their shoes for checking. At the current time, all air travelers, with the exception of those with a disability or hindering medical condition, are required to remove their shoes. Your shoes will be x-rayed, along with the rest of your carryon luggage.</p><p>By familiarizing yourself with the items that are banned aboard an airplane, including items that are only prohibited from being stored in your carryon luggage, an unnecessary incident could be prevented. In the event that you are found carrying a prohibited item, certain steps will be taken. Depending on the item in question, you may be required to return the item to you car, discard of it, mail it to your home, or turn it over to airport security. Ensuring that you leave all prohibited items at home is the best way to prevent this unnecessary tie up, which may cause you to miss your flight.</p><p>Once you have been cleared at the main security checkpoint, you will need to go through one more security checkpoint. This is the final step before being able to board your airplane. When entering the airport terminal, after your airline as granted permission for passengers to board, you will need to present airline officials with the appropriate boarding pass. As this time you may need to show your identification again; however, it isn’t always necessary. Most travelers are easily able to board their airplane, but you may be pulled aside in the event that you are acting suspicious or drawing unwanted attention to yourself. That is why it is best that you stay calm during all airport checkpoints, including the final boarding stage.</p><p>Perhaps, the best way to ensure that your next flight is as pleasant as it can be is to follow all air travel rules. Knowing these rules ahead of time, including the screening process, you should ensure that you are able to board your plane and make it to your intended destination without incident.</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>Word Count 682</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
