This usually occurs at the late 40’s or early 50’s. The declination of hormonal production extends until the eighties. During this period, physical, emotional, psychological and behavioral manifestations due to declination of hormones become more visible.</p><p>Dr. Robert S. Tan, a renowned geriatrician conducted a study about male andropause which he compacted in his book “The Andropause Mystery: Unraveling Truths about the Male Menopause”. The book deals with the physical changes and psychological challenges met by andropausal men. It serves as an eye opener on how to treat such a dilemma.</p><p>Andropause symptoms vary from one person to another. It is generally affected by the health condition. However, in the study of Dr. Robert Tan, some men between fifty to seventy years old reported the following symptoms: erectile dysfunction, tiredness, sudden mood sways, night sweats and occasional palpitations.</p><p>Aside from the physical changes, psychological changes that challenged their masculinity are augmented during the andropausal years. A man, no matter what age he is, tends to struggle to prove his strong sexuality, composed emotions, intellectual mind, supreme courage, good productivity, and strong personality, character and behavior.</p><p>But what happens when he’s in the andropausal years?</p><p>The testosterone level of a young man at the age of 15-30 is 1000ng/dl. When he reaches the andopausal stage, an alarming drop of up to 800ng/dl causes the many predicaments in his life.</p><p>Dr R. Tan observed that the decrease of testosterone makes andropausal men likely to be more in touch with their feminine side. They become more involved in domestic issues which they use to ignore. They are more attentive to their roles at home such as cooking, house keeping and bonding with their children. They devote much time now for the family and pleasure rather than their business roles. In a sense, the decrease of testosterone level makes them gentler and more domesticated.</p><p>On the mental side, judgment becomes less sharp than they used to be during a man’s early age. He loses his accuracy and sharp mind. On some cases, there are reports of impaired memory which can lead to dementia.</p><p>The andropausal years can be directed to the question of courage. Men who are in this condition has the tendency to become more conservative and less of a risk taker. Fear can easily stun them. While some men fear death, most andropausal men fear to be too dependent.</p><p>The next attack hits the pride of being productive. As a common knowledge, men ought to be dynamic, to be noticed for his achievements and efforts. The source of man’s happiness can be rooted on being the firm foundation of the family. When he reaches the andropausal period, he feels his inability to support his family as well as to manage complex business.</p><p>Personality is not a constant thing. Especially for men who are in their andropausal years, they are more susceptible to trimming down their being impulsive, hyperactive and ambitious. Through the passing of time, male menopause has begun to be accepted as part of aging.</p><p>But with the help of medical science, there are useful strategies formulated to cope up with the changes brought about by andropause. Careful supervision of a trained physician is though advisable.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
