Breast feeding is best for the first year - or more, depending on your beliefs - but all children need to move on at some point. In order to eat the good foods that most need, they have to start off with something that they can easily eat without chocking and without having to chew when teeth may be well limited in number. Some buy their foods for baby, and others decide that they want to make their own.</p><p>You can always trust companies like Gerber, but some don’t. There have been problems with many types of foods, and that makes parents nervous. Even if there are no reports of sickness in regards to baby food on the markets, it is a concern. It seems that every other month something new has to be recalled. Children are tiny and their immune systems might not be as strong as adults, so tainted food is going to hit them harder. That alone is enough reason for some to think about what it would mean to make their own.</p><p>If you want to make your own baby food, you are in luck. It is something that is very easy to do as long as you have a few things. You have to have some containers, and you need a very good food processor. In order for first foods to be edible for babies, they have to be very smooth. Even lumps can cause a baby to spit it back out, or to choke. Get a quality blender or appliance of your choice so this is not a problem when you make your own baby food. Keep things clean and sterile, and you should be fine.</p><p>When choosing what foods you should make, take a look at what most companies recommend for each age group. Some foods work better than others at different ages, so you want to choose the right items. You could even talk with your doctor about making baby food and what you should start with first. For the best food, get organic fruits and vegetables and make sure you wash them thoroughly. Don’t save foods for too long either. A few days maximum is probably safe, but throw out anything older than that. You may be able to freeze some, but make sure you have secure packaging for that purpose. Even foods in the freezer can go bad, and freezer burn is never good.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
