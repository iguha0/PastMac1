All those claims about the sender pulling in $20,000 the first time around; $80,000 the second time; and $180,000 the third time; are just outright lies!</p><p>It’s best not to get involved in ANY kind of chain letter scheme because they ar ALL illegal, and sooner or later, the postal authorities will close you down. If they find that you are, or have been a willing participant, you could be fined, imprisoned, or face a penalty of both as punishment.</p><p>Don’t get involved! Chain letters do not, and will not solve any of your money problems. Anyone, and everyone, with any experience in direct mail - and a sense of integrity or pride in their business - will either quickly toss your letter into the trash or else send it on to the postal inspectors for action on their part.</p><p>Probably the biggest reason why chain letters don’t work, is the continuing efforts of reputable mail order dealers in snuffing out these schemes. Any money actually made or collected by a chain letter is pocketed by the perpetrators. Sometimes the person starting, and promoting a chain letter is able to pull a hundred dollars or so before the postal authorities “nail” him - but getting in as the “third name” on a list has never brought in more than $5 or $10 total - even after such participants have gone to the work and expense of sending out 1,000 letters. Chain letters do nothing except cost you money!</p><p>However, many people are foolhardy enough to “try anything once”, chain letter schemes being no exception. So if you’re one of these people, and you think that by offering some sort of product, you can get around the postal authorities, listen:</p><p>Do NOT mail your chain letter to any established business. Especially, do NOT mail to any “known” mail order dealers. Instead, take your phone book and pick out every tenth name or so, front to back, and send your letters to these people. An even better way would be to pull the names from a city directory</p><ul><li>available at your public library - and concentrate on people living in the less affluent section of town.</li></ul><p>Generally speaking, these people are more “money-hungry”, less educated and completely naive to the “truths of mail order”. These will be the people “most-likely” to take you up on anything with chain letter connotations.</p><p>When you receive a chain letter opportunity in the mail check the names and addresses against those you already have on file, and then discard. Do NOT get involved in or perpetuate incoming chain letters!</p><p>IMPORTANT: Should you receive a chain purporting to sell books or money-making reports, do as advised in the paragraph above. If there is a book or report listed that does interest you, write to the dealer who supplied you this report. You will be able to secure it, or one that better fits your needs.</p><p>Whenever you get a chain letter suggesting the names of companies selling mailing lists, turn it over to your local postmaster. The only time you would ever want to rent or buy names from those companies listed in a chain letter, would be when you already have “tons of money” and you’re doing research to determine how many nixes you can accumulate from any one list. Most of the mailing lists from any of the firms I’ve seen listed as mailing list sources in chain letters, run about 80 - 85% undeliverable, and some of the companies listed aren’t even in business anymore!</p><p>Any kind of letter, but specifically chain letters, that require you to send money to a “printing headquarters” for so many copies of the letter you received in order for you to get in on the “big deal”, with your name and address imprinted - is selling you printing services! They don’t care whether you ever make a sale, or even if you never mail out one of the letters they’re so willing to print up for you - they make their money up-front by furnishing you with printed paper!</p><p>What about multi-level programs by mail? Most are simply “people pyramids”. Organizations that make their profits from new member fees. Before you get taken in, determine if YOU would like to have the product they’re offering - if YOU want it, send for it. And before you start sending out letters to recruit new members, do some common sense market research - what’s the real value of the product; how many people will stand in line to buy it; and how much of your time and money is it going to cost you in order to make a hundred dollars a week in clear profits,,,</p><p>Success with anything is simply a matter of having something DIFFERENT that APPEALS to the WANTS and/or DESIRES of the greatest number of consumers possible - TARGETING your sales efforts to reach the people wanting it badly enough to STAND IN LINE TO BUY IT - and then, make it as PAINLESS as possible for them to achieve SATISFACTION by purchasing that particular item that fulfills THEIR NEEDS from YOU!</p><p>With this report, you’ve got the answers to all your questions, and most of your dreams - Good luck in all your money-making ventures.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
