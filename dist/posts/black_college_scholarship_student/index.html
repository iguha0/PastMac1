for Nation of Islam, a religious and socio-political organization founded in the United States which is aimed to resurrect the mental, social, spiritual, and economic condition of black men and women in the country as well as on other parts of the world.</p><p>He is Malcolm X.</p><p>He was the famous leader of the American civil right movement and won the Nobel Peace Prize because of his promotion of peace and equal treatment of different races throughout the world.</p><p>He is Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p>He is the three-time World Heavyweight Boxing Champion and one of the best pound-for-pound boxers ever existed, which made his way towards the Boxing Hall of Fame.</p><p>He is Muhammad Ali, or Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.</p><p>Each of them has their own world to explore and own business to attend. But there is one thing that binds them as one.</p><p>All of them are African-Americans, or also known as Black Americans.</p><p>A Black American is considered to be one of the members of an ethnic group in the United States, whose ancestors are traced its roots predominantly in Africa. Majority of them are descendants of African slaves who were transported from Central Africa through the Middle Passage to North America and the Caribbean during the trans-Atlantic slave trade (1609-1807). Others are immigrants from European and African nations who are classified by the United States census as African-American demographically instead of socially.</p><p>Their population is estimated to be at 40 million and they are predominantly Christians and Muslims. Furthermore, due to hundreds of events that happened within the history of the United States, Black Americans rose from the ethnic ranks and proved themselves to be called a majority class instead of being in the ethnic class. They have triumphed, producing Black American personalities who succeeded in their respective field of endeavors.</p><p>And all black college students want to succeed in reaching their respective dreams.</p><p>Despite of the popularity of various Black American personalities, poverty is still within the ranks of several Black American families. They experience difficulties in sending their children to college, particularly in exclusive universities such as Harvard and Yale. They can withstand the discrimination that is still present despite of everything that has happened, yet poverty is what they cannot withstand anymore.</p><p>Is there any hope for a black student to study in college?</p><p>Yes, there is.</p><p>And it is through getting a black college scholarship.</p><p>There are hundreds of scholarships available that are not just open to White Americans, but are also intended for Black American students. There you have the scholarships for minority students, college scholarships provided by Black American and African organizations (whether civic or religious), and government-sponsored scholarships for black students. The United States Constitution clearly states that there should be no discrimination in terms of getting a solid and well-provided education to its citizens. Whether you are a white or a black, you are entitled to receive a high quality of education in the country.</p><p>With these scholarships for aspiring black college students, they will be able to fulfill their dreams of becoming one of the successful personalities, just like Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and Muhammad Ali, who have already left a mark in their respective fields of endeavor. Poverty is just a minor obstacleâ€”there is hope on anything, including for a black student who want to take a step higher and get himself to college.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
