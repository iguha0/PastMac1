There are some models that offer a handy automatic tool conversion button or switch that you can push or flip as you move from carpet to hardwood floor.</p><p>Hand held vacuums Hand held vacuums are light weight, can be corded or cordless, and you can even mount most of them on the wall if you prefer. The performance of the cordless models will depend on the charge of the battery, as the battery power drops, so will the suction power.</p><p>The two types of hand held vacuums include straight suction and suction with a power brush. If you are considering a hand held vacuum cleaner, you should consider its primary purpose, if you plan to use it on a regular basis or occasionally on smaller jobs.</p><p>Broom vacuums Stick or broom vacuums are great for smaller type apartments, quick clean ups in the kitchen, or a family room. The benefit of a broom vacuum is the light weight. If you have trouble pushing your heavier upright around, the broom vacuum may come as a relief. You’ll also have the option of getting your vacuum corded or cordless.</p><p>They usually weight 2 - 7 lbs. and allow you to easily store them in the closet, as they take up a minimum amount of space. For quick disposal of the dirt and debris, most models are also bagless as well.</p><p>Wet or Dry vacuums The wet/dry vacuum combination may very well be the most versatile vacuum cleaner on the market today, with numerous attachments and functions it is a very handy machine to have around your home. The canister types can vary from the smaller 6 gallon sizes to the larger 22 gallon sizes.</p><p>The HP ranges as well, from 2 to 10 HP. You should always try to match the size of the unit to the size of the job and frequency of use.</p><p>Upright vacuums One of the most popular features of an upright vacuum cleaner is the bagless system. In addition to the increased performance, there is no need to purchase any bags. Emptying the canister can be a little dusty, although it’s still better than messing with bags.</p><p>Most upright models come with a standard set of attachments that may even include an upholstery tool, a crevice tool, and even an extension wand. A retractable cord and manual or automatic pile adjustments are other common features. A HEPA filter is another common and popular feature found with most upright vacuums.</p><p>Canister vacuums Canister vacuum cleaners normally include retractable cords. Considering the fact that most cords are around 25 foot in length, this feature will prevent you from having to drag the cord around and possibly damage furniture. A push of a button or a slight tug on the cord will retract it into the canister of the vacuum.</p><p>The nozzle can be one of two types, nozzle or power nozzle. To get your carpet as clean as possible, it is recommended that you use the power nozzle, which will agitate the carpet and loosen up the dirt for deeper cleaning.</p><p>Another feature worth looking for is a suction control switch, as this allows you to adjust the flow of air for cleaning delicate material such as upholstery and drapery.</p><p>When choosing your vacuum cleaner, you should always choose the one you like best. The best vacuum for the job is the one you should choose, as things will work out much better that way.</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>(word count 601)</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
