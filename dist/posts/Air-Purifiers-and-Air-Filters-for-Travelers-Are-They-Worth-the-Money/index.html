If you do, you may be concerned about the air that you are breathing inside your hotel room. This may especially be the case if you suffer from asthma or allergies. If you do, you may be curious about air purifiers and air filters that are designed for travelers. As nice as a concept as they do sound, you may be curious as to whether or not they work or if they are worth the money.</p><p>When it comes to determining if travel sized air purifiers are worth the money, you will find that it depends.

Desktop air purifiers are the same way, unless flat, so they do still take up a considerable amount of space. On the other hand, travel size air purifiers are extremely small in size.

You can see this by reading reviews of these necklace-like air purifiers online. There are cases where some consumers felt ill after wearing them for extend periods of time. This is something that should cause you to be concerned.</p><p>Smaller, travel sized air purifiers that resemble desktop air purifiers are nice, but most cannot be considered high end. Typically, it depends on the brand and whether or not HEPA air filters are used. In all honesty, if you truly need to have cleaner air, it may be best to bring a high end compact air purifier from home with you. Of course, be cautious when doing so; be sure to pack well. Since high end home air purifiers are expensive, you will not want damage yours.</p><p>A great alternative to investing in travel sized air purifiers that may not work is by carefully choosing your hotel. First, ask if air purifiers are used in the hotel rooms. Some hotels do now use them, especially after being wished for by guest. If you cannot find a hotel that uses an air purifier, be sure to choose a room where pets and smoking are not allowed, as this often means that the room’s air is much more cleaner.</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>Word Count 558</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
