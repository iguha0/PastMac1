For instance, if you want the world to know that you have a beautiful little baby girl, all you need to do is to post a blog on your site or on a blogging community saying such proclamation. If you are not yet contented, you can display the picture of your baby girl by means of photo blogging. Simply post her picture and the whole world will know.</p><p>It is good if that will be the case. However the power of blogging is now beginning to be used for black propaganda. In what sense? Take the following instances: There are individuals who are using blogs to exercise their political rights by revealing some horrible expose about certain federal officials that generates personal revenues from a government-funded infrastructure project.</p><p>The point here is anyone can actually make a blog without any censorship that will prevent him to post what he wants to post. Much worse, the identity of the blogger is at great risk. What if that federal official founds out your real identity and will make way to eliminate you out of his way? Not only your identity is at stake, but also your life as well.</p><p>But the above-mentioned concerns should not prevent you from writing blogs especially if you have good intentions in doing so. Instead, you should be inspired to keep your blog private or accessible only on particular trusted individuals.</p><p>This article will show the simplest precaution you can take on how to maintain your personal privacy so that you can still express yourself without facing worse or even fatal consequences. If followed correctly, these precautions can save you from the consequences and from embarrassment or just from plain weirdness in front of your friends and co-workers.</p><p>Blog Anonymously</p><p>The safest way to express yourself especially when your blog contains uncensored or weird items is to blog anonymously. It is just like writing a poem and taking the “Anonymous” as your author’s name. However, being anonymous in a blog is not just as easy as you might think.</p><p>For instance, you want to make a blog that tackles your terrible working environment in your company without risking your boss or co-workers discovering that you are eventually writing about them. Here are some of the techniques and technologies you can use to make it hard for anyone to trace your uncensored blog back to you.</p><p>Avoid Mentioning Exact Details about your Blog’s Subject</p><p>If you will be creating a blog about your work, never give exact details that will pinpoint directly to your workplace. Details such as where your company is located, how many employees are there, and the specific work it offers should not be revealed. Be generalize in everything that you will place in your blog.</p><p>Use Pseudonym to Hide your Identity</p><p>Obviously, you need a pseudonym to hide your real identity. However, you need to use pseudonyms that are not related to any information about yourself. For instance, do not use pseudonyms that contain the jumbled letters of your name or jumbled numbers of your birthday. One small personal detail can give your identity away.</p><p>Use Anonymizing Technologies</p><p>If you are still uncertain of the first two techniques, there are several technical solutions you can use to keep your identity anonymous.</p><p>•	Invisiblog- a web service that offers anonymous blog hosting for free. You can create blogs without giving out your real name. Even service administrators do not have access to your name as well.</p><p>•	Tor- it is an anonymous network that routes your Internet traffic through a so-called an overlay network that hides your Internet provider address. It makes hard for anyone to follow the path your data takes.</p><p>•	Anonymizer- it works as the same as Tor, only that it hides your IP address from the services hosting your blog.</p><p>By just following the techniques and technologies suggested in this article, you can now blog without fearing that your real identity will be revealed.</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>Word Count 678</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
