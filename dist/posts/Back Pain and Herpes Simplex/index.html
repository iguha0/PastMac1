I want you to continue reading however before jumping to any conclusions. If you feel threatened at anytime, seek medical advice. Herpes simplex is not spelled out in doctors’ offices. This is a serious nerve condition, which not only causes back pain, but…</p><p>The condition can lead to Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or what is commonly referred to as AIDS. The viral infection is not necessary transmitted through sexual engagements. Rather, the viral infection can develop from T-cells. The disease is a defect within the T-cells that mediate the immunity system and permits the development of this mortal opportunistic viral infection. The disease is life threatening when the immunity system is low, since it is characterized by microorganisms of a junior disease.</p><p>The disease is not necessary serious, yet it can become the cause, or pathogenic and/or life threatening when a host has lowered the immunity level.</p><p>HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) can cause herpes simplex to develop. If during testing doctors discover HIV viral infections, which co-exists with one or more pointer viruses, such as herpes simplex, mycobacterium, cytomegalovirus, and/or candidal viral infections, thus the condition is labeled deadly.</p><p>Herpes simplex causes lower back pain, since the disease erupts when the emotions and physical capabilities are put to the test. The musculoskeletal at this point is intensified and/or exacerbated. During testing experts search for dementia, wasting patterns, Kaposi sarcoma, and pneumoncystis. Dementia is an intellectual and cognitive deteriorating condition that progresses as it carries onto the brain where movement is controlled and senses are restrained. Memory loss occurs when dementia is present.</p><p>Blood transfusions, using contaminated needles, infected uterus blood, etc can cause HIV, or herpes simplex to emerge. Semen contact, secretions from the vagina, intercourse, and handling secretions from the vagina and semen can cause HIV.</p><p>Anytime a person is exposed to infected body fluids or blood it puts them at risk of HIV. HIV affects the lymphocytes, which travels in semen and secretions from the vagina. Blood carries the viral infection as well.</p><p>When HIV is, present it carries lymphocyte infections into secretions of the vagina and semen while transporting it to small breaks in the mucosa membrane and the skin. HIV travels and expands into retroviruses that infect selective cells, especially those that contain CD-4. Antigen carries CD-4, which rests at the surface. The lymphocytes are primarily T-4s. At this stage, HIV will reproduce within the T cells or lymphocytes and begin destroying the cells. The destruction of the T-cells damage muscles, joints, etc, which causes resistance abilities to drop.</p><p>Symptoms: Symptoms may include fatigue, anorexia, weakness, weight loss, fevers, recurrent diarrhea, pallor, malnutrition, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, dementia, confusion, and disorientation. When herpes simplex has not developed into AIDS (Not that it will in all cases), the outbreaks often occur sporadically, and causes tingling and burning sensations in the vagina or penis region. A greenish-yellow discharge will follow. The symptoms will start, skip a few months, and develop again if the patient is overly distressed. Doctors usually treat herpes simplex by using medications, such as acyclovir.</p><p>In extreme herpes simplex cases chronic pain occurs, which experts will inject a medicine into the body? (Transcutaneous) The action causes an electrifying nerve simulation (TENS), which relieves pain stemming from herpes simplex.</p><p>The pain sometimes is excruciating. If herpes simplex develops into HIV the pain can worsen still, since the red and white blood cells are affected, as well as transaminase, enzymes, and alkaline phosphatase. The disease herpes simplex can sometimes limit mobility due to excessive pain. In this event, you will need to rest your body, and visit your doctor as soon as possible.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
