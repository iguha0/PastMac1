Burton Snowboarding Gear is one of the best companies to come up with snowboarding equipment that keeps the fun-loving ones in mind. Where other snowboard manufacturing companies tend to focus on professional level gear that’s patterned after “the equipment used by professionals” or some other similar sales pitch, Burton’s focus is on the rest of us who just want to snowboard for fun, have a good time, and stay warm and comfortable while doing it.</p><p>Burton’s lineup involves not only snowboards, but apparel and accessories that focus on stylish appearance, safe performance, and user comfort. While they also have their own line of competition level gear, a vast majority of their equipment is meant for casual enjoyment and usage. Here are some samples of their offerings.</p><p>Kiddie and Beginner Snowboards - these snowboards are designed like bikes with trainer wheels, in that their balance and shape are very forgiving on the slopes. Performance wise, don’t expect to pull stunts with these boards, but if you don’t know much about snowboarding, you can expect that you’ll be eating the snow a lot less than you would with a normal board.</p><p>Intermediate to Advanced Snowboards - these are top quality snowboards designed for speed and agility. If you actually know what you’re doing and want to hit the slopes with a board that will let you strut your stuff, these are good purchases. Just make sure that you really DO know your stuff, as these boards can turn pretty quick, and it you’re not quite as agile as you think you are, you might wind up making a pretty good snowman on the slopes.</p><p>Kid’s Apparel - snowboarding is for everyone, even little kids, and Burton’s lineup takes into account high factors of both warmth and safety in their children’s clothing. Warm multi-layered socks, flashy jackets that make it easy to spot your kids on the slope, and heat-retaining pants are just some of the offerings. There are even additional lines for girls, featuring fleece jackets and beanies. These are meant as much to look good as they are to keep their wearers safe and warm.</p><p>Adult Apparel - these are full sized regular adult snow gear that affords warmth and protection. However, Burton’s winter gear lineup for adults also offers a greater degree of freedom of movement than some other winter gear manufacturers. While still warms and comfy, these jackets, boots, and pants are built light and sturdy to allow for quick and easy motions.</p><p>Gear Bags - Burton’s lineup of winter gear bags are made to mold to a snowboarder’s back during a run. Compact, light, and built with shallow profiles that cut on wind resistance, these bags can be taken on a board with no worries about their weight and balance throwing you off at a crucial moment. Even the arrangement of the straps has been taken into consideration, as they are designed to avoid binding up a person’s arms and shoulders when snowboarding.</p><p>Belt Pouches - Burton also has a lineup of belt pouches that hold small odds and ends if you don’t want to hassle with a full backpack on a snowboarding run. Some of these belt pouches are even specialized, like ones meant to hold the average portable CD player so you can listen to your favorite sounds while you’re on the slopes.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
