He reproduces them in whatever quantity and as often as he likes-usually at a cost of less than 5 cents each, sends out an advertising circular.</p><p>As has been said so many times in countless mail order advice publications, you never really make any real money until you control the product. When you buy the reproduction rights to a set of reports, you control the product. You can advertise the sale of these reports individually via national classified ads, and follow up with your advertising circular as a “full page” advertisement or send it out as part of your direct mail packages. The bottom line is simply that when the orders come in, you keep all the money for yourself, reproduce the reports for pennies and end up with a profit that’s beyond the belief of other people in other types of businesses.</p><p>It’s virtually impossible to convince most people that you can make a profit of at least $1.00 per sheet of paper, but it’s being done every day of the week, and is actually the easiest way there is of making money! Give it a try yourself, and you’ll probably be flabbergasted too.</p><p>The best part of getting started with these folios is that you’ll have an opportunity to see how they’re written, precisely what kind of information they contain, and from there, the background you’ll need to start writing similar folios and reports of your own.</p><p>Let’s say you send for the group of reports on the many ways of making money in various small businesses. Just as soon as you get them, read them over carefully. Make sure you understand and fully comprehend the information and instructions in each report because any one of them-all of them-are very definitely problem-solving reports that can aid you in your own quest for success. Jot down a few notes relative to those you want to use, and/or pertinent information you might want to incorporate into a report of your own-one that you write yourself and not only set the selling price on, but also who or how people sell it.</p><p>The next thing is to take this series of reports to some of the print shops in your area and ask them for a bid on their costs to print up an inventory supply for you. When you finally find a shop that’ll print them at a cost that’s agreeable to you, have a supply printed up. After they’re printed, be sure to separate your originals or masters from the supply you’re going to be selling. It’s best to keep these master copies in a file cabinet or someplace completely removed or separate from where you store your inventory.</p><p>You’re just about ready to start raking in the big money-but first-you have to get the word out that you’ve got these reports ready, and for sale to anyone that wants to buy a copy. We suggest that you select one of the reports you fell will interest the most people-Such a report might be “How to Get Big $$$…”</p><p>Make up a simple classified ad: FREE REPORT! “How to Get Big $$ in Your Mailbox—Everyday! Send SASE to CASH, Box 123, Anywhere USA 01020. Place this ad in as many of the national coverage mail order publications as you can afford to advertise in, and then hang on for a deluge of orders.</p><p>With each order, simply take a copy of this report and include it with a copy of your advertising flyer listing all of your other reports---with your name/address in place ours, of course-and send it back to them in the self-addressed, stamped envelope that they sent you. In most cases, you’ll find that about half of those people who have sent in for a copy of the free report, will turn around and send you $15 for the complete set with reproduction rights.</p><p>Simple-easy-and with a profit potential in the hundreds of thousands of dollars because you’ll find that every one of these reports will sell for years and years to come!</p><p>As mentioned earlier, you should study the reports you buy and from them, eventually write your own reports, making up your own advertising circulars, and not only set your own selling price, but control the number of people selling them. Writing and selling simple “business success” reports is how most of the “biggies” in mail order got their start-it’s the bread and butter of most mail order businesses-and the only right way to go if you’re trying to make it with a minimum investment.</p><p>GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY:</p><p>Send for your FREE listing of the many “How To” reports that you can purchase and reproduce for pennies and sell for dollars.
