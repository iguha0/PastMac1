At first, they were little more than a gimmick. A bagless vacuum was sold on the promise of allowing people the convenience of not having to dispose of a bag, but many of them were messy and ineffective. Not all of them contained the dirt very well, and often some of it would be circulated in the air. It was also kind of difficult to dispose of the dust without spilling some, creating the need for another vacuuming.</p><p>Nowadays, the bagless vacuum is much better than ever before. The design, as far as I can tell, has been perfected. Recently, I had to replace my old vacuum. Although I didn’t trust them at the time, I decided to buy a bagless vacuum on a whim. It was on sale, and I figured that, even if it didn’t work, I could always take it back. I was quite surprised by how well it worked. It had its own built-in HEPA filter, ensuring that none of the dust would be spilled out into the air. This is one of my main complaints about some of the earlier models I have seen, but in this case it didn’t seem to be a problem at all. It kept all the dust neatly inside, leaving no mess to clean off.</p><p>The bagless vacuum was also surprisingly powerful. It was a very slim, simple design, and definitely one of the lower-priced models, but it still does an excellent job of cleaning the floor. I rarely had to vacuum twice, even when going over thick, shag carpeting. It had some good attachments, and would work equally well on carpet, floor, drapes, and even upholstery. Overall, I was quite happy with my buy.</p><p>The only thing that I did not like about the bagless vacuum was the tendency that it had for some of the dust to get stuck. You see, it has a detachable hose that goes from the main body of the vacuum cleaner to the part that actually sucks up the dirt. That hose can be unplugged, and then plugged into various attachments. Sometimes, dirt can get stuck in there, clogging up the bagless vacuum. This was surprisingly easy to take care of, however. All I would have to do was unplug that hose, shake it out in the garbage, and put it back in.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
