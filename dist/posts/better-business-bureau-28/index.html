If I’m getting ready to do business with a company that I am not quite familiar with, I do my homework. Sure, some companies have just been around forever and I can say without a doubt that they have quite a reputation. But, for any company I happen to not recognize or may happen to stumble upon on the internet, I make sure that I do some research first. I take advantage of the Better Business Bureau quite a bit. In my line of business, I frequently am solicited by online businesses that want to attract my attention. I am always happy to get new vendors and suppliers but I have no interest in losing my money or getting scammed. Unfortunately, that happens entirely too often nowadays. So, a quick check with the Better Business Bureau to see if they have a report on them and my decisions are often made much easier.</p><p>Perhaps it isn’t fair, but I very rarely decide to engage in business transactions with a company that has not taken the time to register with the Better Business Bureau. Any legitimate business that wants to maintain excellent customer service and a good reputation should invest in becoming a member of the Better Business Bureau. Displaying that membership logo on your website or in your place of business lets your customers know that your business is viable and important to you. It shows that you care enough about your business to be willing to comply with ethical business standards.</p><p>I have also filed a few complaints to the Better Business Bureau in my years as well. Not all of the complaints that I’ve filed have been businesses that have interacted with my own business. I’ve filed complaints against a travel agency who ended up doing so much damage to an expensive vacation that my entire vacation was a nightmare. They refused to admit that they’d made a mistake and offered no refund. Through the Better Business Bureau, I received half of my money back and an apology. Without the Better Business Bureau stepping in and acting on my behalf, I would have been out quite a bit of my money.</p><p>The Better Business Bureau is a great place to turn when you have tried to reason with a company and haven’t had any success. Once you feel that you simply cannot make a difference, I would highly recommend turning to the Better Business Bureau. It still might not result in anything positive for you, but at least you can say that you tried. Often times, when a business knows that they’ve been reported or will be reported, their tone may change. They may suddenly want to somehow appease the situation. Getting a little bit of assistance in resolving disputes that have escalated can make all the difference in the world.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
