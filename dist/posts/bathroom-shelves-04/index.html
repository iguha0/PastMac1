It was really quite shocking. I had always assumed that the bathroom was an afterthought for everyone. It certainly always was for me. I never bothered with bathroom rugs at all, and I certainly didn’t put a lot of thought into the bathroom shelves. Usually, every house that I would live in would come with cabinet shelving, and it would be enough to work for me. That job was really an eye-opening experience. Apparently, while I assumed bathrooms were unimportant, everyone else was out there trying to get theirs to look perfect. Just goes to show you – you never know.</p><p>Bathroom wall shelves were very popular – particularly in the spring. People are willing to remodel their houses all year, but in the spring they are willing to do the most work. People who buy bathroom shelves in the winter, autumn, or summer, usually just buy a portable bathroom cabinet that fits over the toilet. Installing a bathroom shelf into the wall, after all, is hard work. People just don’t feel like working hard the rest of the year – they’re already working too hard.</p><p>Another interesting thing about working at that job was to see the piecemeal fashion in which people do their remodeling. Bathroom remodeling is a much more chaotic affair than you would think. Whereas people seem to plan out their living rooms, dining rooms, and even bedrooms in detail before they start, people don’t do any such thing with bathrooms. They will buy a bathroom shelf they like, a rug that fits their whim, and some fixtures that happen to be on sale. The bathroom shelves don’t necessarily even match the tile, much less the toilet.</p><p>Still, spending hours every day around bathroom shelves and other plumbing fixtures really got me thinking about how important the appearance of your bathroom is. Between showering, washing up, and everything else, everyone spends a sizable time in the bathroom everyday. By decorating it and making it look nice, you can really ensure that that time is as relaxing and pleasant as possible. After all, there is a reason why people read in the bathroom. It is not just a utilitarian room, but also a place to relax. By making sure your bathroom shelves, tiles, and plumbing fixtures all create a harmonious look together, you can make your time as relaxing as possible.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
