What You Can Do</p><p>Each day, millions of Americas board an airplane. Although many of those individuals do not have a problem, others do. One of those problems may involve the no-fly list. While the no-fly list was designed to make air travel safer, there are some instances when the wrong individuals have been targeted. These mistakes often include mistaken identities or misspelled names. Despite what you are told or may think, there are ways that you can get yourself off of the no-fly list.</p><p>Although you can get your name off the no-fly list, it is important to remember that it will not happen overnight. In fact, if you are notified that your name is on the no-fly list at the airport, it is almost a guarantee that you will not be able to board your plane. Since airport security cannot rely on your word, they will likely not allow you to proceed any further. In fact, you may even be detained a short period of time by airport security. Once you are released, you can begin taking the steps needed to have your name removed from the no-fly list.</p><p>The first step in getting your name off the no-fly list is to the contact the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Once you are notified that your name is on the no-fly list, you should be provided with the contact information for the TSA. If you are not provided with this information, you can easily obtain the telephone number needed to directly contact the administration by visiting their online website. That online website can be found at <a href=http://www.tsa.gov>www.tsa.gov</a>. Once you have made contact with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), you will be provided with instructions on what to do next. Those instructions will likely include filling out a form that should be mailed to you.</p><p>In addition to filling out the proper paperwork, you will also be asked to submit identification. In fact, you will need to submit more than one piece of identification Most travelers need three different items. Accepted items include a driver’s license, a government identification card, a military card, a social security card, a voter registration card, a passport, a visa, or a birth certificate. Although only three pieces of identification are required, you may want to have additional identification documents on hand, just in case. After you have collected these items, they will need to be notarized by the proper officials.</p><p>After you have submitted all of the required documents, the process should begin, which will result in your name being removed from the no-fly list. This process could take as little as a few weeks, but it could take months. You are advised against making any travel plans until you receive confirmation that your name has officially been removed from the no-fly list. Once your name has been removed, all airlines will be notified of this removal. This should mean that you are now able to purchase airline tickets and make travel plans.</p><p>In addition to actually having your name on no-fly list, namely due to a mistake, there is a chance that someone else with the same name as you could be on the no-fly list. Despite the fact that you are not the one on the no-fly list, you may experience some problems. For that reason, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has developed a traveler verification program. In the event that you are commonly mistaken for someone else, it may be a good idea to register for that program. Information on this helpful program can be found by visiting the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)’s online website. As previously mentioned, that website can be found at <a href=http://www.tsa.gov>www.tsa.gov</a>.</p><p>Although getting off the no-fly list may seem like a long and frustration task, it is something that you will want to do. Chances are your name will not magically disappear from the list. This means that if you are planning on traveling, now or in the near future, you will want to take the appropriate steps to ensure that you will make it to your intended destination.</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>Word Count 679</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a href=/posts class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600">Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
