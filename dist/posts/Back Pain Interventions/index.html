According to statistics, more than 200 million Americans alone suffer back pain. Some patients endure surgery, while others find ways to minimize the pain. Unfortunately, some people turn to alcohol and drugs to relieve such pain.</p><p>When pain is chronic, it makes it difficult to cope with daily duties. Most pain in the back starts at the lower region. With so much suffering, many people make a hobby out of finding relief.</p><p>Back pain mild or chronic can slow activities, mobility, and so on. While there are, many medical causes and sometimes-mysterious causes the fact is the majority of people in the world fail to maintain ROM of the joints by stretching and exercising regularly.</p><p>For this reason, back pain is the number one cause of time loss and money spent. The fact is back pain alone is one of the prime reasons that people must call in to work sick. According to statistics, the increase in back pains the total estimate of loss and medical costs soars up to $60 billion dollars annually.</p><p>Some people are lucky. That is some people mysterious experience back pain and in a few months, the pain vanishes, never returning. Lucky dogs!</p><p>While the large percentage of people soon recover naturally from back pain, another percentage makes up 100 and these people find relief by modifying their weight, adjusting sitting arrangements, and stretching.</p><p>Still, others suffer enduring back pain. Some of these people will sit inappropriately in chairs, or on couches until they lower back finally dents, forming the shape of the chair position they had sit. These people often spend a lifetime indulging in over-the-counter meds, such as analgesics. If they would get off the couch, align the back with stretch exercises and support of Chiropractors, thus the pain may disappear.</p><p>Still, other people suffer life-long back pain due to injuries, trauma, disease, and so on. The downside is these people rarely get the treatment they deserve, since it is rarely recommended by doctors. In short, doctors will often recommend over-the-counter medications, i.e. painkillers to resolve the problem. Doctors rarely tell patients to exercise, diet, etc. Sometimes you may hear, “Loose some weight,” yet the doctor will rarely tell the patient how it is done.</p><p>Painkillers work to eliminate inflammation and sometimes pain, yet what doctors fail to tell the patients is that some of these painkillers are in fact killers. In addition, painkillers do not have the same affect on all persons. For sure, some painkillers will reduce pain for some, while others may continue hurting.</p><p>This leads us to drug addictions and alcoholism, since these people need help coping with the pain, and if doctors are not offering that help, thus drugs and alcohol is the answer. We have another problem.</p><p>In view of the facts, back pain recoveries lay behind information. When a patient has an idea as to what is causing his/her pain, thus he/she can move to treatments that help them to find relief.</p><p>Fact: When a person is aware of cause, effect, only then can he take action to eliminate the cause. When a person is aware of cause, he moves to acceptance, in turn acceptance moves him to act.</p><p>How do I find the cause? You find the cause by researching your condition. Once you begin research your eyes will open, which leads you to discuss with your doctor, treatments to eliminate your pain. Doctors prescribe medicines, recommend tests, and encourage surgeries in some instances, thus these people rarely focus on REAL HEALTH, which includes exercise.</p><p>Exercise has proven to reduce even the worst back pain. Exercise has gone as far as proven to prevent death from internal injuries. Most people would ordinary die after six months from internal injuries; however, one person stood against doctors and should them that exercise is the gatekeeper to good health.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
