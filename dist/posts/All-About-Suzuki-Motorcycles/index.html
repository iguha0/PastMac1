He had a very successful looming business when he decided to invest in the concept of motorcycle manufacturing in 1920. Suzuki didn’t take the motorcycle world by storm, in stead it was a slow and steady rise to success. There were a variety of motorcycle models that had moderate success. People began to take notice of the Suzuki line of motorcycles after their Diamond Free model won the Mount Fuji Hill Climb in 1953.</p><p>In June of 1954, Suzuki implemented their trademark “S” logo that is still used today. They also put their years of observing the motorcycle industry to good use. 1962 saw them as the winner of the Grand Prix World Championship. Suzuki decided to begin selling its motorcycles in the United States in 1963. They have come a long way since that first introduction. Consumers quickly took to the models, finding them to be valuable and reliable.</p><p>Suzuki introduced the X-6 Hustler in 1966, becoming their first street legal performance bike. At the time, it was also the fastest 250CC on the market. They followed the success of it with a 500CC model called The Titan. In 1969 Suzuki took the world by surprise when it introduced the GT750. This was a two stroke motorcycle that could reach a speed of 110 miles per hour. It was able to accelerate from zero to sixty in only five seconds. Since this motorcycle was so well received, Suzuki decided to make a larger bike with the same type of power. The RG500 became the most successful racing bike of that era.</p><p>Suzuki continued to dominate the motocross racing circuit in the 1970’s, winning the World Motocross Championship in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1976. Due to tighter emission regulations, Suzuki had some stumbling blocks in 1976. However, they were successfully able to redesign their four stroke models to meet these regulations. They models also sold very well.</p><p>Suzuki again make racing history with the introduction of the XN85 in 1982. This was a turbo charged motorcycle that won many high profile races. The first American to win the World Motocross Championship did so in 1982 on this bike. In 1986 they offered the GSX-R, also a turbo charged racer bike. What made it so original was the aluminum frame. This made it the lightest motorcycle in its class.</p><p>In addition to selling large quantities of racing bikes, Suzuki has done well in the cruiser market as well. The Boulevard model comes in many different sizes to meet the needs of the consumer. This is a very sporty looking model built to look great as well as to offer comfort. The five speed transmission allows the operator of the vehicle to remain comfortable regardless of the riding terrain.</p><p>The body of the Boulevard model allows for a smooth ride regardless of the speed at which you are traveling. This model is one of the top selling cruisers out there as well as the best price with the 2007 models priced around $13,000. Each one comes with a 12 month unlimited warranty that can be extended. Suzuki offers the best warranty of any motorcycle manufacturer with unlimited miles, no deductible, reimbursement costs if the motorcycle breaks down, rental vehicle reimbursement, and the remainder of the warranty is transferable should you decide to sell your motorcycle during the warranty time frame.</p><p>Today, Suzuki is in the top four motorcycle manufacturer’s world wide. They offer a wide variety of street, off road, and racing motorcycles to choose from. You can find Suzuki motorcycles at more than 1,600 dealerships around the world. They are well known for offering style, comfort, and speed with hundreds of different models to choose from. They are also among the top sellers because the models are very attractive, the price is very reasonable, and they stand behind their products by offering an excellent warranty.</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>Word Count 657</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
