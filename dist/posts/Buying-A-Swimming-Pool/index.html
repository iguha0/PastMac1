Each one has something to offer you and your family, although there are also differences, which you should know before you make that final decision.</p><p>The shape with your pools is important. In ground pools come in oval, kidney, and square shapes. Above ground pools on the other hand are only available in round or oval If you have a large family or a lot of friends who like to swim, you’ll want to get a shape that can support a lot of swimming.</p><p>Size is also important, especially for families. Above ground pools are much smaller than in ground pools. Pools that are in the ground are a lot bigger, and offer you several different sizes to choose from. They cost a lot more than above ground pools though. Above ground swimming pools use less water, although they will also limit what you can do in your pool.</p><p>If you like to dive, you’ll have to get an in ground pool. Above ground pools can’t have diving boards, as most are only 6 foot deep. This isn’t a good diving height, which is why you won’t be able to dive with an above ground pool.</p><p>Buying an above ground pool will save you a ton of money. The money that you save, can be used to add to your pool area, such as a deck or privacy fence around your pool. If you choose to buy an in ground pool, you’ll spend a lot of money. You won’t need a deck though, as they are easily accessible. If you add a privacy fence to your in ground pool, it won’t have to be near as high as it would with an above ground pool.</p><p>Installation is also a consideration with your pool. You can normally install above ground swimming pools by yourself with little to no help, in a few hours. In ground pools on the other hand, take several days to install and they must be done by a professional. This can get costly as well, racking up a hefty bill before you realize it.</p><p>Making that final choice really comes down to what you hope to get from your pool. If you need a lot of space or want to swim laps, an in ground pool is your best choice. If you need a smaller pool for yourself or your kids, an above ground pool would suffice. The choice is entirely up you though, and what works best for you. If you are on a budget or don’t have a lot of money to spend - you would be better off going with an above ground swimming pool.</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>(word count 468)</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
