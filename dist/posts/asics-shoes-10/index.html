Not only is running an excellent way to stay in shape, but it’s also a fantastic way to satisfy my competitive nature. I still participate in as many 5k or 10k runs in my area as possible, and sometimes even travel to big cities like Boston and Chicago to give those famous marathons a shot. Like most competitive runners, I take my equipment very seriously. That’s why I was a bit leery when a friend of mine recently gave me a pair of Asics shoes for my birthday. I had never worn Asics shoes before and wasn’t exactly thrilled at the prospect of changing.</p><p>However, it was obvious that my friend had gone to a lot of time, trouble, and expense to get this present for me, so I felt that I had to at least give them a try. I told myself that I would wear the Asics shoes on one short run and then come up with some reasonable-sounding excuse as to why I couldn’t wear them anymore. I could just say that they didn’t fit right, didn’t offer enough protection, or simply weren’t comfortable enough. Then I’d be able to go back to my regular footwear without any guilt.</p><p>But then something unexpected happened when I was out on my test run: I discovered that I actually liked my new Asics shoes! They were very lightweight and actually felt good on my feet without any breaking-in period at all. I didn’t get any blisters from that first run with my Asics shoes, which is something that always happens to me when I wear other brands. In short, I became an immediate convert and decided to buy several more pairs of Asics shoes as soon as possible.</p><p>I knew better than to try to buy Asics shoes from a regular sporting good store. Through a lot of trial and error over the years, I’d been able to find a half-dozen or so excellent websites that specialized in running gear. I went directly to those sites and saw that a couple of them were offering great discounts on Asics shoes at that time. I ordered two more pairs on the spot.</p><p>I’ve been wearing Asics shoes exclusively for a few months now and have not been disappointed in their performance. I was completely correct in my assessment of Asics shoes after that first trial run, and know that I’ll be using this brand for a long, long time. I’m just thankful that my friend took a chance on buying me that first pair!</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
