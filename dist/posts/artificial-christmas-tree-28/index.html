But, there are some drawbacks to some of those joys as well. Along with the fresh pine smell that comes from your Christmas tree, you have pine needles being discovered throughout your house. The dog takes a few hundred sips of water from the tree stand every few hours. The branches become flimsy and start losing ornaments. For millions of people, the joys of having a live Christmas tree in their home is simply a nuisance.</p><p>Getting an artificial Christmas tree can take all of those inconveniences away. The branches are sturdy and can hold heavier ornaments. The dog will quickly discover that there isn’t any water to drink. And sure, you may miss the fresh scent of pine but you can compensate for that by getting a live wreath for your house. Or, you can get some scented air freshener. Granted, it won’t be quite the same but perhaps the conveniences of getting an artificial Christmas tree will make it worthwhile.</p><p>Of course, the cost of an artificial Christmas tree can be quite a bit more than a live tree. If you can find a great bargain after the holidays are over, you may be lucky enough to get an artificial tree for cheaper than you would have paid for a live tree. Yes, you’ll have to wait for the next Christmas, but, think of the savings you just encountered!</p><p>You can even walk through your local superstore and find prelit trees, decorated trees – whatever you need to make your life easier. If you have storage room for the tree, you’re all set. Most of the artificial trees come apart in sections, making storage much more convenient. Some people, however, choose to simply keep their tree together and decorated, just stashing it in the basement for next year.</p><p>For those of you who are concerned about the environment, saving a tree once a year can be rewarding as well. If you buy an artificial Christmas tree instead of the real deal, you will be doing your part in saving the planet. Sounds a bit corny, right? Not necessarily. If you aren’t supporting your local Christmas tree farm or sales, that’s one less tree that has to see the end of its days. Of course, someone else may end up having that same tree cut down, but at least you can know that you did your part. There isn’t a constant need to grow trees for years and years, simply to cut them down for one simple holiday. After a few weeks, those trees are discarded. With an artificial Christmas tree, you won’t have that concern. You’ll know that your perfectly shaped Christmas tree will be around for years to come.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
