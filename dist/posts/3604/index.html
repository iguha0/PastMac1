Total sales each year for the past five years have increased by almost 30-percent over the previous year’s sales.</p><p>Two “new angles” have greatly contributed to this phenomenal growth in total sales.</p><p>One is the practice of offering a wide selection of books via “mini-catalogs” The other “angle” is the practice of sending these “min-catalogs” to prospective buyers as “inserts” in printed materials the prospect has already ordered.</p><p>Mini-catalogs are usually printed on 8 1/2 x 11 sheets of paper, then folded in half along the length, and simply slipped inside the covers of a magazine or the folds of a newspaper. Often-times, a mini-catalog is folded and sent out as a self-mailer. Both of these methods of obtaining circulation are very profitable.</p><p>A book-selling “mini-catalog” is made up of a “full-page commercial” on the front page. This is your main sales thrust, or primary attempt to sell a “featured” book with ease of your mailings. The second, third, and half of the last page of the min-catalog should be two columns of listings of other books you have to offer.</p><p>Each listing should consist of the title of the book offered, followed by a short description of either the book itself, or how the book can benefit the buyer. This is then followed by the catalog number of the book, and the price.</p><p>The bottom half of the page of your min-catalog should be devoted to your customer order coupon. The “mini-catalog” should be typeset, and printed on a different color of paper for each mailing. Recent sales results indicate that the better quality paper your mini-catalog is printed on, the more sales it brings in for you.</p><p>Two major publishers who are currently supplying ready-made catalogs for your use in generating business are;</p><p>PREMIER PUBLISHERS of Forth Worth, TX, and WILSHIRE BOOKS of N. Hollywood, Ca.</p><p>Write to them on your letterhead, and ask for samples of their promotional material.</p><p>Once you’ve got a mini-catalog with which to advertise your books, you must bring all your efforts to bear on the problem of obtaining maximum circulation of your mini-catalog among the prospective book buyers.</p><p>The easiest and least expensive method is as follows: Check at your newspaper offices for a listing of all their distributors and/or route carriers. Contact these people and ask them to give you a price they would charge to include one of your mini-catalogs with each paper they sell or deliver. Determine how many “min-catalogs” you’ll need for this kind of distributors, have that number of min-catalogs printed, hand them out to your contracted distributors and newspaper carriers; then sit back and prepare to fill book orders. It’s simple and easy, but best of all it really results in big profits for your book-selling business!</p><p>Another simple method would be to line up students from different junior high schools in your area, and pay them each $10 per thousand to deliver your min-catalogs door-to-door. If you have junior high school age children, this could be the easiest and least expensive method of distribution for you.</p><p>Major cities also have professional distributing services which deliver advertising material to the residents. Check your local phone directory for their names and addresses.</p><p>The orders which you develop through the local distribution method can be filled by mail.</p><p>To expand your market beyond the local area, you need to solicit the business by mail. Several excellent books are available on developing sales by mail. A few are listed here. Order from the distributor who supplied this report to you.</p><p>#366 FORTUNES WITH BOOKS MANUAL, BY LEE HOWARD…$7.95 #360 FREE ADVERTISING FOR MAIL ORDER DEALERS…$10.00 #365 &amp;50,000 A YEAR FROM MAIL ORDER ADS…$10.00</p><p>THE END OF THIS REPORT</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
