After her daughter-in-law died, she needed comfort, and she started to go back to church on a weekly basis. I’ve very glad she did, because she’s getting so much comfort from the church and the people who go there. Buying for my mom used to be hard, but because of her renewed faith, she always wants us to get her Bible books. In fact, that’s all she ever asks for anymore.</p><p>Bible books are easy to find, and you can find Bibles of all types just about anywhere you buy books. Bible books come in all different languages, and you can find different versions. If you belong to a church, they probably have a certain Bible they use, and if you buy one, you want to get the same one so you can follow along. There are some people that just like one type of Bible book more than they like the others. Even though the King James version of the Bible is harder to read, if you grew up with it, it may be the Bible of your choice.</p><p>You can find Bible books for the beginner as well. These are great for children, as they are written in simple language, and there are often study guides to go along with what they are learning. There are also great Bible books that are made for those with bad eyesight. You can get ones that have a larger print so you don’t have to squint to read the pages and see the words.</p><p>There are also story Bible books out there you can buy. I had a few of these when I was young. They told many of the most popular and enduring Bible stories, but did so with illustrations. They are also worded so children can understand what is going on, and the lessons within the story are spelled out for them. These are great gifts and can be found where you buy other Bible books.</p><p>If you can’t find the Bible books you need in your local stores you can look online. You may find them on large named sites like Barnes and Noble, or you may find that special book you can’t find anywhere else on an auction site like eBay. The Internet may be the only place you can find out of print Bible books, or other wise hard to find versions of the Bible.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
