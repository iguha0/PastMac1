This allowed for a quick and effective darkening of the skin; but after long exposure it is found to be very dangerous to the skin, and which extreme result could lead to a skin cancer.</p><p>Next, finding an alternative produced the first tanning product released in 1960’s; results gave you effective darkening of the skin, but, alas, also gave you streaked, orange coloring, which is far from realistic tanned color.</p><p>After that first attempt, there are tanning products that proliferated in the cosmetic market and all promising to provide effective tanned result. There are basically two kinds: tanning from the inside products, which include tanning pills and tanning accelerators; and tanning on the outside products, which include tanning bronzers and tanning lotions and sprays. These products are applied differently and depending on the reliability of the product brand, both can be effective on tanning your skin.</p><p>But recently, all those sunless tanning applications have been clouded by what seem to be the quickest and safest application from yet another excellent innovation of California Tan: the California Tan Mist-on Tanning booth. Not too long ago, the industry has benefited from this easiest application provided by the tanning booth.</p><p>What is this California Tan Mist-on Booth?</p><p>The tanning booth can be found on professional salons and spas where their professional technicians will assist you in getting the tanned look from the spray equipment. It literally sprays a very fine mist of self-tanner so you get a uniform coating of the tanned skin color from head to toe. It uses state-of-the-art misting technology, that’s why you get tanned all over your body without the streaks.</p><p>The application finishes in minutes (in most customers, up to 7 minutes which included time spent putting clothes on and off) with your skin not only achieving instant golden glow but also feels soft and supple due to the quality moisturizers that come with the bronzer.</p><p>Applications start by misting your skin that finishes in a matter of seconds; after which, you towel-buff and then you are done. The naturally, golden brown will set in after 8 to 12 hours. The first few minutes produce instant color. It intensifies for the next 30 minutes. After an overnight, intensity of the color doubles and even higher quality of bronzed skin and typically lasts for about 7 days.</p><p>California Tan Mist-on booth sprays will not leave you a fake tan look</p><p>California Tan tanning products have been known to produce effective and natural-looking tan glow on the skin. Making it further an effective and convenient application, the mist-on booth sprays allow you to sport a realistic tan color. This is because the tanning spray has formulas that able to control color variations. This means that the reaction will depend on the skin type and natural color. Fairer-skinned people will get a lighter tan color than with those olive-skinned persons upon application. Thus, the mist-on sprays are ideal for everybody who wants a sunkissed, bronzed glow.</p><p>What to remember when getting a tanned look through California Tan Mist-on booth</p><p>The spray tanning booth is the best answer for those people seeking the quickest and safest bronzing of their skin. However, you must also remember that you should not rely on the application to protect your skin from the sun rays too. If going out and exposure to sunlight is unavoidable, you must wear a sunscreen at least 15 times the sun protection. Remember your tanned glow is natural so it can get burned from the UV rays.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
