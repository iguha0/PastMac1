This happened to me once over an air hockey table. I was just out of high school, and was hanging out with some friends before going off to college. A girl asked me if I would like to play air hockey with her, and I said that I would, even though I had no idea who she was. As we played, she started asking me things about my childhood. Though this was a little weird to me, it was a fun conversation.</p><p>What I didn’t know was that the girl across the air hockey table from me was one of my best friends from childhood. We had spent quite a few years as friends until her family had to move away, and as it usually happens, we had lost touch with each other. I was amazed when she told me who she was, and once she said her name, I had no idea how I had not known it. She looked much like she did when she was young with the same hair style and the same grin she had always had. She had just gotten taller and looked older.</p><p>Now, every time I see an air hockey table, I think of that day. We stayed in touch for a little while after that, but eventually we drifted off. We had not seen each other in so many years, and we simply didn’t have anything in common any longer other than memories from the things we had done together. Had we lived near each other our entire lives, we may have stayed friends even until today, but I guess that was not meant to be. It doesn’t stop me of thinking fondly of her when I see an air hockey table, but I do realize that not all friendships are meant to last forever. Perhaps it is better that way anyway.</p><p>I have thought about her a lot recently, as my dad told me that he was thinking about getting an air hockey table for his basement. He already has a pool table there, and he also has a very cool video game setup where he can play games with others around the world. He said that he found a great price online for such a table, but he wasn’t sure if he was going to pay for shopping or find one locally. All I know is that when I go to see him again, the first thing I am going to do is play with the table, and teach my daughter how to play.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
