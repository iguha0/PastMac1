If you are now mailing four times a year increase the frequency of your mailings to size or eight times. If you increase your mailings by 25% you should increase your sales by at least the same percentage.</li><li>Use a P.S. on every direct mail letter. The P.S.S is second in importance only to the headline.</li><li>Don’t forget to thank your customers for their orders by enclosing a message with the orders…and enclose another merchandise offer with the “thank you” message.</li><li>Vary your mailing format - use self-mailers, Lettergrams, computer letters, envelope formats, catalogs…change your format so that prospects don’t get in the habit of recognizing your mailing piece.</li><li>Ride on the coattails of current events (energy crisis, elections,, cold winters, etc.) When inflation increases, have an “inflation-cutting” special, etc.</li><li>Look for other products you can successfully sell to your customers.</li><li>Include more offers in your mailing package than you already are.. Study the mailings firms such as the Haband Company who pack a volume of material into their envelopes and see if you can adapt the idea to your own mailings.</li><li>Think about using simulated handwriting for emphasis in your letters. Occasionally test a handwritten letter…particularly if you’re soliciting funds for charity.</li><li>Try an unusual format that you’ve never used before.</li><li>Test selective distribution to your list. Maybe only a portion of your list should receive more mailings. Other mailings should go to the entire list.</li><li>Stimulate off-season business by asking for it.. If you normally have a summer slump have a special “summer sale” mailing in the summer. You can boost your sales any time of the year you need a boost through effective direct mail.</li><li>Word your offer differently - put a unique twist into it by offering a baker’s dozen instead of a regular dozen.. Or sell 110 instead of 100.</li><li>You can even add a smell to your envelopes. Check with your envelope manufacturer about special inks that can be used to make your envelope “smell” the way your product does. 14.. Change the size of your mailing package frequently to create interest and appeal.</li><li>Test credit terms.. You’ll find that Master Charge or Visa Bank Americard will result in larger orders than cash terms.</li><li>Let people “peek” into your envelope with multiple windows on the face and back.</li><li>Test buck slip routing for addressing…and use it to reach multiple prospects.</li><li>Try using illustrated letterheads and test them against conventional letterheads.</li><li>Put a simulated check into your mailings to emphasize a discount..</li><li>Consider using stamps, coupons, early bonuses, etc.</li><li>Pack order starters - a special offer that will get a person started on his order - into your catalog..</li><li>If you can sample your product, test including a sample in your mailing..</li><li>Make more sophisticated use of your own list and the lists you rent by looking for those segments of people in a list who buy.. and forget the rest of them.</li><li>Test simulated telegrams. Mailgrams, other imitation formats similar to the Mailgram.</li><li>Test a tiny letter with a tiny pencil accompanying it. Test a jumbo letter in your envelope…maybe even mail it in a jumbo envelope.</li><li>What is your “wastebasket readability factor” and what can you do to get people to read your mailing piece when it is sitting on somebody else’s desk… or has already landed in his/her waste basket?</li><li>Put a wraparound on your catalog. It gives you two covers instead of one.</li><li>Test your catalog mailing and mailing dates.</li><li>Use teaser copy on your outer envelope and test its vs a blind envelope.</li><li>Acknowledge orders promptly, and include additional sales literature with your acknowledgement.</li><li>Periodically send a statement to your customer that shows he’s been missed - even if he doesn’t owe you any money.</li><li>Follow up inquiries promptly and persistently. Make it easy to buy from you by giving the inquirer a return envelope to send his order back in.</li><li>Tie in with a timely topic (current events, special problems, etc.).</li><li>Get to know your printers - not printer, printers. Every direct marketer needs different types of printers with different capabilities to come up with different printed pieces.</li><li>Test multiple premiums with your offer and give your prospect a choice of the one (s) he prefers.</li><li>Put your letterman on your team - make your best selling products sell most..</li><li>Remail your mailing to your best customers three or four weeks later.. You’ll do 60-75% as well on the second mailing as you did on the first.</li><li>Look for creative new ways to increase catalog sales.</li><li>Remember the five basic rules - test, test, test, test, test.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to run without a test if your gamble is small.</li><li>Use good judgement in planning your direct mail and you won’t go wrong.</li><li>Use a bounce-back package enclosure to get an extra order.</li><li>State your guarantee in the strongest possible terms..and state it often. 44.
