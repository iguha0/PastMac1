The trails begin at the Island Park Village and end in a steep and thrilling area of rough and unpredictable snow drifts that are difficult to navigate through. The wide open space causes the snow to stick to the trees to form spectacular sculptured landscapes that make the treacherous snowmobile ride worth every minute.</p><p>Yellowstone National Park offers several other wonderful trails to make any snowmobile riding vacation a pleasurable experience. The Big Springs Trail is rich in mountain terrain with warming huts along the way for snowmobilers to rest and appreciate the surrounding scenic views of the mountain landscape.
