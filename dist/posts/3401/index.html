The trouble is, not many of these people seem able to fit “a second job” into their time schedules.</p><p>It’s true that most people are busy, but extra time for some sort of home-based extra income producing project can almost always be found. It may mean giving up or changing a few of your favorite pastimes—such as having a couple of beers with the guys or watching TV—but if you score big with your extra income project, you will have all the time you want for doing whatever you what to do.</p><p>Efficient time management boils down to planning what you’re going to do, and then doing it without backtracking. Start by making a list of the things you want to do tomorrow, each evening before you go to bed. Schedule your trips to the store or wherever to coincide with the other things you have to do, and with your trips to or from work. Organize your trips to take care of as many things as possible while you’re out of the house. take stock of the time you spend on the telephone---and eliminate all that isn’t necessary.</p><p>Whatever chores you have to do at home, set aside a specific time to do them, and a specific amount of time to devote to them. For instances, just one hour a day devoted to yard work would probably make your property the envy of all your neighbors. Don’t try to do a week’s work in one big flurry. Whether it’s painting your house, fixing leaky faucets, or mowing your lawn and trimming your shrubs, do a part of it, or one particular job each day, and you’ll be amazed at your progress.</p><p>Take care of all your mail the day, you receive it. Don’t let those bills and letters pile up on you. If you’re unable to pay a bill immediately, file it in a special place that’s visible, and note on the envelope the date you intend to pay it. Answer your letters the same day you get them.</p><p>Once you start listing and planning what to do, and then carry out your plans, you’ll find plenty of “extra time” for handling virtually any kind of home-based income producing project. People in general may not like routines or schedules, but without some sort of plan as to what is supposed to be done, the world would be mired in mass confusion. Laws, ordinances and regulations are for the purpose of guiding people. We live according to an accepted plan or way of life, and the better we can organize ourselves, the more productive and happy we become.</p><p>The secret of all financially successful people is simply that they are organized and do not waste time. Think about it. Review your own activities, and then see if you can’t find a couple of extra hours in each day for more constructive accomplishments.</p><p>When you begin planning, and then when you really become involved in an extra income producing endeavor, you should work it exactly as you have organized your regular day-to-day activities---on a time basis. Do what has to be done immediately. Don’t try to get done in a hour something that’s realistically going to take a week. Plan out on paper what you have to do—what you want to do—and when you are going to do it. Then get right on each project without procrastination.</p><p>Finally, and above all else, when you’re organizing your time and your business, be sure to set aside some time for relaxation. Be sure to schedule time when you and your spouse can be together. You must not involve yourself to an extent that you exclude other people—particularly your loved ones—from your life.</p><p>Taking stock of the time you waste each day, and from there, reorganizing your activities is what it’s all about. It’s a matter of becoming more efficient in the use of your time. It’s really easy to do, and you will not only accomplish a lot more, you will also find greater fulfillment in your life.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
