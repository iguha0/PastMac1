As I got older, I found that I was starting to fall in line with the health conscious attitudes that I swore off in my youth. Mostly I have become fixated on getting lots of protein every day. I have a big appetite and a slow metabolism so I need to eat foods that fill me up without making me balloon out.</p><p>I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on protein mixes, shakes and bars but I have not found anything that I can stick with for a long period of time. I have gone through many periods in which I would drink a slim fast high protein shake for breakfast every day. This got boring pretty quickly.</p><p>Until not very long ago, I thought that I hated beef jerky and I would never buy it or try it. Running out of protein options, I thought I had better give jerky one more try before I crossed it off of my list of protein possibilities. I have a sensitive palette and I prefer bland foods to spicy ones. This issue makes enjoying beef jerky a bit difficult but I have found that it can be a great, healthy source of necessary protein.</p><p>I looked for a brand of beef jerky that did not contain any hydrogenated oils or trans fat. I found a store brand for about ten dollars a pound which lasts me about two weeks. When compared to the shakes and mixes, the beef jerky is a much more affordable option.</p><p>Make sure that you read the entire list of ingredients when picking out a brand of beef jerky because if you are loading up on calories and fat, it kind of defeats the purpose in my opinion. It can be difficult to get fifty grams of healthy protein every day while living on a budget and beef jerky can be very expensive. I have had greater success when looking at store brands.</p><p>I have been able to cut down on the amount of food I eat by replacing simple sugars or carbohydrates with protein and fiber. Even though it can be difficult to eat a lot of protein and fruits and veggies at the workplace, a supply of dried foods such as beef jerky and dehydrated fruits can go a long way. If you are trying to lose weight or just eat healthier, look for natural products as often as possible. You take two steps back when the “health foods” you eat are loaded with fat, preservatives or unnatural ingredients.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
