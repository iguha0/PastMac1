When something like this happens, there is a very big chance that the system has been infiltrated by a virus, spyware or adware.</p><p>Everyone surely knows how dangerous viruses can be. It can shutdown the entire computer that will cost the individual a lot of money just to have it repaired. But what about spyware and adware? How dangerous are these?</p><p>Spyware are programs designed to send certain information back to the programmer. This may include bank account numbers, credit card numbers and anything else important. Someone can use this to buy items without the owner really knowing until the bill comes which is already too late to do almost anything.</p><p>Adware on the other hand will show pop up ads that are really quite annoying even if the person did not log into that site. It might inform the user there is a virus in the computer even if there is none and those who click on it will get it thus causing more problems.</p><p>Given that this problem has happened in homes and in offices, software companies have come out with various versions of spyware and adware programs to help get rid of it. The program will first eliminate the existing ones in the computer and then create a firewall keeping future ones from entering.</p><p>The individual will notice that some of these are free while those made by the major corporations charge a certain fee. This can either be bought from the store or downloaded from the web, which usually comes with a free trial period that will surely impress and eventually make the customer buy it.</p><p>Having a software program that can fight against spyware and adware will help prevent damage from happening to the computer. In fact, since there are new threats everyday, the designers have even come up with updates that can be uploaded automatically keeping everything in check.</p><p>The person can choose to pay but given that it performs the same function, why not get the kind that is free?</p><p>One good example is Ewido designed by the Grisoft Group. It can handle spyware and adware as well as other threats such as Trojans, dialers, worms and keylogger.</p><p>Spybot Search and Destroy is another popular brand. This is compatible for windows based operating systems, which has been recommended for use by both PC Magazine and PCMag.com.</p><p>Adware is another known program. If the user will use this for personal things, then this can be downloaded for free. Those who use it for commercial purposes will have to pay a small fee.</p><p>Those who choose to download the spyware and adware program for free should be careful. This is because there are some that are bogus and when downloaded, can cause big problems to the computer. This can be prevented by doing some research first and then deciding what to do next.</p><p>Computer security should be everyoneâ€™s concern. A simple slip up or ignoring this could be disastrous later on because the cost for repairing the unit could almost be the same as buying a new one.</p><p>With that, it is up to the individual whether to get one that is free or pay a little extra to be able to feel safe at all times.</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
