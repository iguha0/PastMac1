Here is your chance! Universal Studios Tours now has Fear Factor Live, which is a stunt show that uses audience volunteers. With three to five shows each day, the chances of getting on the show are pretty good!</p><p>Are you ready to face your fears? There are some important things to know about Fear Factor Live at Universal Studios Tours before you sign up. First, this is for real. This is not a cheesy attempt to replicate Fear Factor and please a studio audience. The stunts are very real, and they are performed by audience members just like you. There is no coddling here!</p><p>If you still want to participate, simply visit the casting office, which is located near the Terminator ride in the theme park. You must meet certain physical requirements to ensure that you can handle what is about to be asked of you. You must also complete and sign a liability form, holding Universal Studios and Fear Factor harmless of any injuries or damages you may incur.</p><p>Before the show begins, some audience members who were not selected to participate are called on stage to face smaller challenges, such as eating various bugs. The winner of the pre-show contest wins great prizes, such as an annual pass to the theme park. This is followed by an audience warm up with the hosts of the show.</p><p>The show consists of six contestants that were chosen from the casting office – if your lucky, you might be one of these! They are dressed just as the contestants on the original Fear Factor dress – in tight uniforms. A series of challenges, much like the challenges on Fear Factor are presented to the contestants. Falls from high places, skill tests, and of course, the famous gross-out challenge. During the show, a random audience member is picked for yet another challenge – such as sticking their head in a tank full of scorpions.</p><p>If you’ve ever watched Fear Factor, and told all of your friends that you could handle everything that was thrown at those contestants, be careful. Here is your big chance to prove yourself – or your friends’ chance to prove you wrong! Win or lose, Fear Factor Live at Universal Studios Tours could be the highlight of your visit! If you want to be on the show, visit the casting office as soon as you get to the park to make sure that you meet the physical requirements – and if you don’t meet the requirements, ask about being in the audience.</p><p>(word count 429)</p><p>PPPPP</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
