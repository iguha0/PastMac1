Sometimes during the holidays people will step up and get involved where before they wouldn’t. It’s possible, anyway.</p><p>The game goes something like this, and then will be described in more detail later. You print up a few poems and instructions on colorful paper (likely, orange). You get a treat bucket, or bowl or something and fill it with candy. You can also “Boo” people with candles, Halloween socks, and really whatever your imagination comes up with. You “Boo” two people at a time, leaving the items anonymously on their doorstep. You leave it with the instructions and the poem and hope they “Boo” other neighbors. Once you are done, you tape up a large “Boo!” on your door so neighbors know not to hit you up again.</p><p>Specifically, here’s how it’s done. Start this game around the very end of September or very beginning of October. If you want until everyone is decorated for Halloween, you’re probably too late. You want this to spread around the neighborhood and that takes time, so you want to start it right as the season starts (or a little before, perhaps) and just as people are starting to think about Halloween. If you start too early, however, you might be out of luck as far as being able to purchase items goes.</p><p>So, it’s the right time of the year and you’re ready to go. Find a “Boo” poem and photocopy it. There are many variations of the poem. Here is a sampling:</p><p>“Boo! To our good friends on the street; Our homes’ locations made us meet; You now have been Boo’d, but who would we be? We’ll never tell, it’s a secret, you see. We placed these goodies for you and yours; Then we ran fast, after knocking the door! Happy Halloween!”</p><p>Or it might be a big longer, something like this:</p><p>“The air is cool, the season fall Soon Halloween will come to all; The neighbors are after things to do In fact, a neighbor brought this to you; “Boo” is a sign of friendship power Just hang it up and watch it double by hour; On your front door is where it works It wards off solicitors and scary jerks; The treat that came with friendly note Are yours to keep; enjoy them both; The power comes when friends like you Copy this and make it two; Then others here among our friends Will give warm fuzzies that will not end; We’ll all have smiles upon our face No one will know who “boo’ed” whose place; Just one short day to share your Boo You must be quick so they don’t know who; And don’t forget a nifty treat Like something cute or something sweet; Please join the fun, let’s really hear it And spread some “Boos” and neighborhood spirit!</p><p>Be sure to include a cute graphic of a ghost or something else that looks like it might say “Boo!” You might want to include some details on the flyer about what should be done next, in case you think the poem itself won’t be clear enough. Then attach the poem to the goodie bag, basket, whatever you have created, and run out one night dropping your goodies on peoples’ doorsteps. If you are just getting this started in your neighborhood, be sure to do more than 2 houses. You might find that some people don’t participate and in that case, you want to have “Boo”ed enough people that you will get adequate participation.</p><p>What you’re striving for is a neighborhood full of “Boo” doors by Halloween night!</p><p>PPPPP</p><p>Word count 665</p></article><footer class="flex flex-row justify-between mt-16 text-lg"><a class="dark:text-blue-400 text-blue-600"href=/posts>Back to posts</a></footer></section></main></body></html>
