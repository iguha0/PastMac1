Bad breath is noticed mainly by the friends &amp; family members or some times person himself feel it and come to the doctor.Many badbreathers develop depression which forces them to be away from the society which in turn hampers their activities.</p><p>The protein in the food debris are degraded by the anaerobic bacteria present in the mouth.Offenssive odor is produced due to release of some gases like hydrogen sulphide,skatol ect due to bacterial activity.Formation of a thin sticky membrane on the tongue favoures bacterial growth.Bactrera are also seen in the crypts of tonsils ,dental caries,dental pockets ect.Bad breath is associated with oral hygiene,caries,gingivitis,tonsillitis,tonsillar plaques,food habits,water intake ,tobacco chewing,stomach and liver diseases and ect.</p><p>Homoeopathy is a system of medicine introduced by a german physician Dr Samuel Hahnemann.Homoeopathy treats the diseased individual as a whole rather than treating diseased parts or organs.The physical,mental,emotional,social spheres of a person is considered for a permanent cure.This system believes that the diseases are caused due to the derangement of vital force which is an invisible power in every individual.In a healthy state the vital force maintains the equilibrium of mind body and soul .During this man will have normal sensations and functions.When the vital force gets affected there will be external manifestations in the form of signs and symptoms.The imbalance in the body functions makes a shelter for forign organisms(bacteria,viruses,fungi,protozoa ect) and allow them to proliferate &amp;produce so called diseases.Homoeopathy believes thet the real desease comes before the bacteria &amp; viruses,hence the root cause of the disease has to be treated for a permenent cure.The antibacterial and antiviral agents only remove the secondary causes mentioned above.</p><p>Diseases are produced by noxious morbific agents called Miasms which are dynamic influences which affect the vital force.There are mainly three miasms PSORA ,SYPHILIS&amp;SYCOSIS. These three causes are accepted by other schools of medicine but called by different names. Psora causes functional disturbances, syphilis cause structural changes in the form of destructions and sycosis causes changes in the form of overgrowth.These three miasms can act individually or in combined form producing different disease conditions.</p><p>To treat bad breath with homoeopathic medicine is easy if correct remedy in suitable dose is given. In the homoeopathic medical repertory by Dr Robin Murphy there are 140 homoeopathic drugs mentioned for bad breath.So just giving one drug for bad breath may not give good result.To come to a correct remedial diagnosis we should have the symptomatology of the person .It is the total symptoms of a person which includes mental generals,physical generals,particular symptoms ect.Bad breath is considered as a physical general symptom .Eventhough it comes only from a part of the body it affects the whole individual.</p><p>Symptoms related with appetite,thirst,bowels ect are included in physical generals. All signs and symptoms (mental&amp;physical)of the person is taken in detail.Knowledge about past illneses,family history of diseases,food &amp; bowel habits,relation to climatic changes and constitution ect are noted down in a systematic order.</p><p>Mental symptoms:</p><p>example: fear,anxiety,depression,anger,jealousy and ect…</p><p>Physical symptoms:</p><p>example: Body makeup,appetite,thirst,desires,aversions,bowels,urination,sleep,taste, nature of smell,discharges any abnormal sensations like pain, burning ,climatic changes,thermal relations, and ect…</p><p>Peculiar uncommon symptoms:</p><p>This is the speciality of homoeopathic system of medicine.For the selection of a suitable remedy these symptoms are very important.common symptoms which are seen almost in all patients are least important.</p><p>particular/local signs&amp;symptoms:</p><p>This include signs &amp;symptoms related to body parts &amp;organs.</p><p>example: Coating on the tongue,nature of mucus membrane of oral cavity, tonsils, gums, teeth, ulcers, discolourations ect are considered here.</p><p>Systemic &amp; general physical examination:-</p><p>Bad breath can be due to various systemic and disorders.Hence all systems ( respiratory system ,digestive system,nervous system, cardio vascular system and ect )and parts from head to foot should be examined.</p><p>provisional disease diagnosis; Here probable diseases are diagnosed. In homoeopathy disease diagnosis is not that much important for the selection of a remedy,but needed for general management and to know the prognosis.</p><p>Investigations:</p><p>This includes lab investigations and other methods to find out any other major illnesses.</p><p>Final disease diagnosis:</p><p>After doing all investigations the disease is diagnosed.</p><p>Remedial diagnosis:</p><p>This is the most importnant part as far as homoeopathy is concerned. For this the selected symptoms are arranged in a systematic order on the basis of importance.<br/>symptoms are analysed to find out the importance of each symptom for the selection of a remedy.Remedies are selected on the basis of similarity.[the basic principle of homoeopathy is ‘similia similibus curenter’ means like cures like.A medicine which can produce some symptoms in a healthy man can be used as a remedy to trea the similar symptoms in a diseased person.Each homoeopathic drug is proved on healthy human beings and the symptoms collected by this process(drug proving) is written in meteria medica.]</p><p>Suitable remedies are diagnosed by a process called repertorisation. Here books called repertories are used. Repertory is the index of symptoms of materia medica(books which contain the symptoms of drugs).Nowadays computer softwares are used for repertorisalion.By this process we will get the remedies covering maximum important symptom of the patient.</p><p>Amoung this group of remedies the most suitable remedy is selected by referring various books and history of the patient..The selected medicine is given in suitable potency &amp; dose.</p><p>ANTI MIASMATIC TREATMENT:</p><p>The root cause of disease is miasms which should be eradicated using suitable anti miasmatic drugs.Every drug can eradicate the miasm if there is symptom similarity.there are anti psoric drugs,anti syphilitic drugs and anti sycotic drugs.After diagnosing the miasm suitable anti miasmatic drug has to be given to complete the cure.</p><p>[In homoeopathy medicines are prepared from different sources like minerals, plants, animals, toxins, diseased parts ect. Medicines are prepared from these substances by a special process called potentisation.Here the soluble substances are potentised by diluting with spirit and insoluble substances by grinding with sugar of milk.The crude drug substance is first mixed with a calculated quantity of spirit and water and kept for few days .From this mixture extract is taken and is called mother tincture(denoted as Q).From this mother tincture dilutions are prepared by potentisation.Potentisation is a mathematical process by which the quantity of original drug substance reduces but medicinal power increases. Depending upon the ratio of quantity of drug substance and vehicle(spirit or sugar of milk)there are different scales for this process.Each scale has got different potencies which indicate power of medicine.Example in decimal scale 3x,6x.12x ect.in centisimal scale there is 30c,200c ect,in LM poteny there are 0/1,0/2,0/3 ect.potency is written after the name of every medicine]</p><p>Same medicine is available in different potencies. Suitable potency is selected according to so many facters like sevearity,depth of disease,condition of the patient ,nature of disease ,type of symptoms,age of patient and ect.</p><p>Some useful homoeo drugs for bad breath.</p><p>Arnica montana, Antim crude, Ars alb, Asafoetida, Aurum met, Baptisia, Bryonia,Borax,Calc carb, Carbo veg, Cinchona, Chelidonium, Graphites, Kali bich ,Kreosotum, Lachesis, Lycopodium, Merc sol, Natrum mur, Nitricum acidum, Nux vomica, Plantago, Pulsatilla, Phos, Pyrogen, Sulphur etc.</p><ol><li>Arnica montana:</li></ol><p>This medicine is useful for fetid breath.Mouth is very dry with thirst for water.Bad breath associated with fever.There is bleeding from the gum,may be after tooth extraction or after injury.Offenssive gas pass upwards and downwards from stomach.Petient is very sensitive to touch with sore and bruised feeling allover the body.</p><ol start=2><li>Antim crude:</li></ol><p>Useful for bad breath with gastric complaints and coated tongue.This medicine act mainly on filthy persons with aversion to bathing.Tongue is coated white like fur.Nostrils and lips are cracked .Eructations are putrid.Very useful for badbreath in children</p><ol start=3><li>Ars alb:</li></ol><p>All discharges are having cadeveric smell.Saliva is bloody with bad odor.Thirst for warm water is well marked.
