Local government is getting property taxes and fees. Sometimes, it is also financed by income tax. Consequently, the state government is financed by the combination of sales and income taxes. Finally, the federal government is financed mainly by income tax.</p><p>Taxation is an inherent power of the government. It is treated as its lifeblood because it is the main source of the state’s revenue. The revenue flows and maintains the life of the state. This is reflected in government programs, infrastructures, and the like.</p><p>Without taxes, it is hard for the government to survive. In addition, the imposition of taxes is aimed at supporting government’s operations and functions. Taxes are also used to influence the performance of economy, redistribute resources among citizens, and to modify employment and consumption patterns within an economy.</p><p>There are several types of taxes. The first type is income tax, which is a progressive tax. To make reliable collection, the government allowed direct withholding. Another type of tax is the capital gains tax, which is the tax imposed on the profit from the sale of an asset.</p><p>Corporation tax is the company’s tax on the profits. Poll tax, also known as the capitation tax, is the tax levied on a set amount per person. Excise tax, on one hand, is an ad valorem tax based on the declared value or purchase price of an item.</p><p>Another type is the sales tax, which is levied on a particular sale of a commodity. The final consumer is liable to pay said tax. Tariffs are tax on the importation and exportation of goods through a political border. Value added tax (VAT) or the goods and services tax is the equal of sales tax. However, the former reduces market distortion. Property taxes are based on the value of the involved property. This is usually imposed on real estates.</p><p>Stamp duty is the charge for the stamp needed in a particular document. Inheritance tax, on the other hand, the tax imposed on the transfer of property by virtue of one’s death.</p><p>Your hired tax attorney must know these taxes as well as the taxation system of the state for you to take advantage of the best legal remedy available to you.
